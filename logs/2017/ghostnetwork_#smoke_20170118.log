[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah I can grow six plants now.  Only thing that kind of sucks is I can't grow outdoor
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> can i apply for refugee status due to persecution and lack of medical care?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> A medical marijuana card
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> fuck yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Word prem I think you can say you have PTSD from running out of weed and then get a prescription
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> whats considered as out door? can you grow in a greenhouse?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well if I had a backyard I could grow it out in the open
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I don't have a yard lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha gotchya
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Still though, pretty badass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ...does it have to be on your own property / your residence?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> fuck yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think you can sign someone up as like your care provider or something but I don't really wanna do all that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yea fuck that noise
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Indoor winds up being better anyway lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh for sure dude, there are way too many variables outside
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive always wanted to do a crop with the sun & lights combo though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think they do that out in humboldt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> an indoor/outdoor/greenhouse type setup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ohh different than what I was thinking
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> get the power of the sun, then switch over to lights when the power starts to drop
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> greenhouse++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> *sun starts to drop
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .tell Laz fym
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> .tell Laz asmd
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well they kind of do that in humboldt but they just shine big ass baseball stadium style lights on the crops
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah I would love to have a greenhouse
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> dayum
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> there's also a vote system. you can say something and do ++ or -- and it will keep all-time channel stats on the votes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that sounds amazing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> b++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .points b
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> idk what for, just fun
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Homegrowing is so much easier now than it seemed when I use to read about it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> benzos++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I had plans to like, setup DIY rooms and lights and all this crap
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Now you just buy a tent, a fan and a light and you're pretty much set
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> gotta love it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's nuts how like, legit it all is in a legal state too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> didnt take long for the industry to explode
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Like, technically homegrowing in WA isn't even legal without a card, but you can still go to certain gardening stores and get a "marijuana grow light" right off the shelves
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i love that you guys have like, an artisan micro-brewery type setup with some strains
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> shits amazing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Shits the bed it doesn't seem like there's any money in
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> literally what ive always dreamed about
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol eggbot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Buddha shooter
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * prem finger guns
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I wanna do some breeding of strains and stuff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Technically I have a Cherry OG x Platinum Girl Scout Cookie strain that's totally unique, but it doesn't really count as a "strain" until you stabilize it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And for all I know it might be mediocre, or maybe even crap by some weird genetic long shot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * prem drools
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> girl scout cookies are one of the few strains ive had
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word, shit gets scientific
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's like, become the dirty slut of weed, but for pretty good reasons
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> gotta send off some samples to the lab and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> There's actually a lab in town I can go and get my shit analyzed for THC content and stuff...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :')
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> speaking of, brb water change
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> kk
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I've seen their cards too, they have little QR code labels so people can just quick scan them with their phone and see the report online...  Like this shit is badass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> havent been smoking morning b's so the waters been extra fucked up recently
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But you gotta use like 3 grams to test, plus pay $40 (supposedly if you're a med patient $80 if not )
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats fucking dope
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh for sure, definitely worth it if you're producing though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha prem SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh well all the recreationaly producers have to test legally
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> good, thats fuckin awesome

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Offer up some thought about it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wellt here's a lot to choose from...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> GYN explains why it would be crazy to follow Gwyneth Paltrow's advice of using rocks inside your vagina. 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> There's been so much crazy bullshit news lately that I don't even know what to consider interesting or not.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Obama paraonded Chelsea Manning, Obama setting the record for most sentences commuted on the same day, and some woman dying in Nevada of a illness resistant toa ll 26 known antibiotics
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i dont know what to consider news
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> word those were up there for sure
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Out of those I feel like the antibiotic one is the least boring
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But then again the whole Chelsea Manning thing...  Jeez
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> We would aggro the whole card looks good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the real news in the chealsea manning case was that the propaganda machine never stops turning
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> obama made some smart ass comments about snowden, cant quite remember the exact quote
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I think what's sad is Leonard Peliter was up to have his shit commuted too but aparently Chelsea Manning was more deserving
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> gonna have to google the name
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Seriously though the whole Chelsea Manning thing...  Like, I feel like that's going to be come the symbol of what conservatives think of liberals.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> trump--

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I would take Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump in a heartbeat.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> And she's awful.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no doubt, its almost a coin flip
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> you get all the other republicans with trump tho, so, yeaaaaaaaaaa
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I would have been like
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> "Trump you think Hilary is terrible right?" He'd be like "Yeah, yeah, uuuge cunt"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Then I'd be like, "I hate you so much more than her, I will eat her ass out right here in front of BIll and you and the world if you just quit"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yuuuuuge
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think the real lesson is that a politician doesnt have to win. everyone seems shook as fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it honestly looks like all the 3 letter agencies are shitting their pants
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they didnt expect it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm just saying I don't think Trump really understands how much he's hated
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> clear
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> balls

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> usually watch one a week with my boy but ive been drunk as fuck recently
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its probably the only show i do weekly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I was thinking how much of a bad idea it would be to drop acid and watch that shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it took me over 10 years to get this dude to watch evil dead
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> as soon as he saw the first ep of ash, he smashed the trilogy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have been meaning to rewatch them too but the show is just way better imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh fucking oath
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its everything i ever wanted and more
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im honestly shocked at how good it is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I like how they kept so much of the puppetry and old effects
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> fuck yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> you just cant do a show like that with cg
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its a good chunk of why its so good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well there is some cg but like, only in good touches
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh yeah, no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> as long as its used as seasoning, it good. you just dont want it to be the meal
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <ZigZag> test
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :O
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * SagaciousKJB remembers I am Legend
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ugh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> have you seen the alternate ending for that movie?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think so but I barely remember it either way
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it actually almost redeems it, though the cg was still trash
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The only good scene of that whole movie was when he strangled his dog, and that's like...  You know a movie is bad when that's all you can say positive about it.

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> .bang
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> This whole playing shows thing has me really nervous and I haven't even signed on to do one ye.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> First off I don't think I'm 'good enough' but beyond that, anxiety is a bitch.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's BYOB so I'll probably chug a 40 and blare the harshest shit I can
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> BUt still
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Playing what kind of shows?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I mostly make harsh noise
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> So it's small crowds and short sets
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But I always hated even like, having a part in the school plays growing up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> .bang
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah stage fright sucks
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> And because of the nature of the genre its like
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> What if some of my gear just shits out?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Backup gear?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I can't afford new pedals :/
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> If I could I'd just get something new
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well shit I guess just cross your fingers lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Pretty much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> My setup consists of a mixer, three pedals, and a keyboard/guitar that I probably wouldn't bring.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Bring the guitar man, you never know if shit goes wrong you could just improvise and be like 'Going unplugged!"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I play the guitar with a hockey stick though so I'd have to bring that too lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm a little worried about a reading I have to give at the college
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well, was asked to do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But anyway, like, I get dry mouth like a motherfucker and kind of mumble sometimes so yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Will be interesting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> This will be more autistic screeching and flailing around likely
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I might just throw the mic at someone's head
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We'll find out when I get there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean, they might think that's cool
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I usually end up naked and bloody when I record at home, so
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We'll see 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The frontman of MSI pisses on the crowd and they dig it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Was thinking more GG Allin style
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Piss on myself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Piss on a bat and bite it's head off
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ooh now i need to source a live bat
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Then beat its headless body witha  guitar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And light it on fire
