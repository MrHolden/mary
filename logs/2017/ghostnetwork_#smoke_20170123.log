[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> bah, playing skyrim, watching football.. in my mind I'm fucking a patriotic falcon
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> I'm sick of worthless people and want to lynch about 15 motherfuckers today.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> Not bad for a Sunday.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> not too bad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Skyrim is so great
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I've been playing Hitman tho
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> Dude I can't wait for the next elder scrolls
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> With the advances in platforms since Skyrim, that shit could be intense
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> And with what, probably 5 more years of waiting to go, yeah, it'll be pretty sweet
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> if I live that long.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * H5 strokes time's dick
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * Buddha videotapes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> Think about this, if time ejaculates.. what is the result..?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> Space?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> Time can obviously be bent if I can get it off, therefore could the resulting space also be bent and molded to what I will?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> Holy shit I gotta go get some rubber cement brb
