[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> what screws are you extracting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> She had that bots are often deaf
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i typically drill those cunts out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> CHeap ass ones that came with my security camera
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I'm trying not to really mess up the beam they're in those because it's at my apartment
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I guess if I got a drill bit with a bigger diameter than the screw head....
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> doesnt necessarily have to be bigger than the head, just the thread
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh yeah I got yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm trying not to leave little headless screw bits in the thing though. I'll probably just end up dremeling it or something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> LIke with a little cutoff wheel
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh yea, true that. make a new spot for the driver to go in?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's basically what this thingy I got was suposed to do

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's setup to go in reverse though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i was thinking it was one of those ones that are sort of like pliars
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Has a counter-sink on one end and then like, a little tap on the other that is supposed to thread in and grab the new hole
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Never seen them

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Went down to the hardware store and bought a pound of actual screws for like a dollar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> In truth they come with these little green plugs you'res upposed to like, press into a pre-drilled hole

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man I sure blew through all my financial aid money quickly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha damn dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> you got all your books and shit taken care of?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah my books were cheap as shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I got new tires, paid off a ticket, got a new tablet, and I kind of lost track of it after that lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Probably a lot of food lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha for sure, that shit adds up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i pretty much bankrupted myself last year from food and cigs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah tires were like $700 and the ticket was $150, and the tablet was $120 so...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> still tryin to recover
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man cigarettes are terrible
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Like, money draining
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> for fucking real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> OHH I got my med card too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THat was another $150
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive gotta try something drastic
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But fuck man these were all like, good investments so *shrugs*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> maybe get a couple of ozes so i have no cash at all
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats about the only way i can see it happening
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You'd just trade weed for smokes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Grow your own tobacco
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha probably. right now im activly chosing not to get a half bag weekly in favor of a pack of cigs every day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the fucked thing is i only like my brand of cigs. i absolutely dispise other brands
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive tried cheap shit, illegal shit, rolling tobacco
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah dude that's rough
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it all just ends up being an additional cost
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah dude I set out growing weed to save money versus buying it and like, I'm not really sure how that's working out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no kidding, access is definitely a defining factor
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> if you got nugs you smoke em
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> what was that law of diminishing bags..
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah, and then you just end up spending the same money on other shit anyway
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's not like the need for other shit goes away because you got weed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> How do I add that quote
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> prem's law
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> "...there is an accepted and irrefutable phenomenon which defies the conventionally known laws of supply and demand. ...the Law [of Diminishing sacks] cannot be avoided through any conceivable corrective measure. It is simply an unchangeable fact that an uptick in supply will be met by an uptick in consumption, thus negating any perceived supply-lengthening benefit from increased supply purchase."
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have/had something like 5 ounces, and like, I need to stop being so frivolous with it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> prem SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I tried to buy a little from one of the stores so that I wouldn't dip into my own as much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> and on that note, im out of bud and down to kief
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But that didn't work much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I need to get a screen for my grinder again
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no kdding dude, especially with how crystally your shit is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that shit would produce a ton of goodness
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah I know, I keep thinking about that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Really wanting to get some clones off the remaining plants I have of this, get some seeds of my own
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man the friend that I had been getting them from is just like, a total dipshit slacker asshole who is just leaving them laying around in a sandwich baggy...  Logn story short I better not hold my breath
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> for sure yo, you should do it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i got some cloning powder and juice for like $3 a pop
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have all the shit already, but last time around I kept them way too moist
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They all damped off and yeah, I just scrapped them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> damn, sounds like you're about due for another attempt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But if all else fails I still have these crossed seeds I made with it, just never sure how a cross will come out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah if I ever get these damn plants recovered
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh yeah, they're still looking a bit sad?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> guess i was only speaking to you about it a couple of days back :p
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah, well, kind of not sure if I've given them too much or not enough nutrients
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I am waiting for them to dry out to give them more, you'd figure they'd dry out faster given the RH in the tent is like 15% lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Relative humidity
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I hate when people make initiatils out of stuff and make you guess lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> are they yellowing at all?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that one was pretty obvious given the context but i feel you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh dude, they're fucking yellowing, the cripsying up, some are purple
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's fucked
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hmmmmm
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think the soil is just exahusted
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> again, i dont know enough about weed, but typically yellowing is lack of nutrients
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ahhhhh yeah thats right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> *typically in other plants
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I mean, the thing is I gave them some nutrients and then I thought I noticed the leaves burning at the tip
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I gave them less, and now they're starving
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah its definitely a fine balance when your soil is fucked
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Neighbor gave me some stuff to amend the top layer with, but I"m kind of suspect of it, so I only tried it on two plants.  Waiting to see
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's like some secret recipe bullshit he mixes up from a bunch of other sources and sells to people
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I don't know man, never did much for me before when I tried it and he won't even tell me what's in it past the basic ingredients. guano, oyster shells, all the basic organics
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> where the fuck are people collecting guano
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> seabirds aparrently
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> but word, thats annoying as fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I don't know I feel like all it's going to do is fuck my soil pH up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i thought guano was the term for bat shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I chose the worst looking plants as guinea pigs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> If they get better, well, then I know it's good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> good choice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah me too but I guess there's other sources
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> dude, go get your ass a couple of bags of soil and transplant those hoes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> shits like $1
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol It's not that cheap here for good shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And so much of it comes with bugs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ugghhh yeah fair point
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> theres some utter shit out there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> good soil definitely aint cheap as dirt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I use to buy this black gold shit that was fairly cheap
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yo brb, washing machine just went off. i gotta go hang up some curtains to dry
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Take advantage of that summer air
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they havent been done in years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> id personally buy a couple of bags of the shittiest soil, a bag of compost, a bag of worm castings
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> get a nice blend going
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> cant trust any of that shit to be good on its own
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I mean, I'm thinking of just ammending the shit Igot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no doubt, no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> just makes it a little tougher when the plants are already in there :p
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ohh I got ya
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I bet it's a bitch to heat in the winter
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh yeah dude, it fucking blows. we have an 80s beast of a central heating system to heat the fucker
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i honestly have to wonder how safe it is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> looks like a furnace for an apartment building
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> prem SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Oh shit one of those oil heaters huh

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> runs off gas so uhhhhh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know I don't even use mine because it takes way too much gas
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Fucking $100 bill keeping it at like 70 degrees in the winter
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah dude, we try not to run it cause it bankrupts your ass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha this thing is at least $400 for 3 months
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah and natural gas is supposed to be cheap here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I basically just use space heaters and then cover up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lol for sure, im all about those layers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i look like a woman with the amount of accessories ive been getting the past couple of years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .bang

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know actually I've never used suspenders
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> My go-to for when I no longer give a fuck will be over-alls

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> god. damn.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I gotta write some summary of a news article for my communications class
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> do you get to choose the article?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's nice at least
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> prem SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it'd be real fuckin nice if they'd let kids choose a topic they're interested in when they're young
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> for every fuckin class.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah instead of forcing them to read something they don't give a fuck about
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> exactly dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm basically writing about the whole alternative facts thing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> 1984 bitches
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> my bad, i was about to get my shit pushed in by 2 skeletons and a zombie
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> go hard on em
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> 2017 is the year of fake news, alternative facts and double speak
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its definitely a good topic to dive into
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah dude the funny thing is as soon as I heard that I was like making 2+2=5 jokes, and meanwhile the 1984 book sales surged over the weekend lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I just basically wanted to find a good article that pointed out the simiarites
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats fuckin awesome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] -!- mode/#smoke [+h CaliGangstar] by Ghostbot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> got a link for the article?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> http://mashable.com/2017/01/24/dystopia-trump-1984/#uqpuIW0JAqqq
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lmao that photoshop
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Haha right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .bang
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> had a quick skim
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i just hope this shit makes people pay attention in the next election
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah dude 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The articles talking about how the sales for 1984 surged said stuff like "That might just be because most schools still require stuents to read it" and I was like "What schools?"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think it was required when ghost was in highschool
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> so uhhhhh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> huh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha yo dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol We were talking about 1984 sales going up and if it's just beacue it's required reading in schools
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah suddenly everyone is a george orwell fan
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it'd be nice if they stay fans
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well at least democrats are reading now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they're about 5 presidents behind
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm just not convinced that it's still required reading in most schools
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I actually read that by free will lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I saw the episode of family guy I'm good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol So I guess the truth is it's all the pepole that didn't really read it in highschool buying it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> only thing we read by him was animal farm
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Actually the sadder irony is that people are like "I don't get all these jokes about 2+2=5, I gotta read this book so I can be snarky on facebook too"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Meh I didn't like Animal Farm
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah wasn't all that good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> huck finn was good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it said nigger a lot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think when I read 1984 I was like, "Hmm, Okay, well it's good but I don't see why people are always prattling about it now"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> To Kill a Mockingbird might be up your alley
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> ...though depending on your perspective, it has a sad ending
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ah yeah we read that one too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that one wasn't a favorite
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But another I actually sought out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah ended up with obama in the whitehouse
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I was in remedial classes where we didn't actually read the classics, and I was like, always hearing people preach on about them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I got let down mostly, that's why I never bothered reading all the other shit people talk up so much.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> LIke fuck Thoreua, never reading that douche
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> "Ohhh I live on a lake, society sucks, look at me"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> we read all kinds of shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think it didn't help that my school district was known for high rates of illteracy lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> whole damn year dedicated to shakesspear ugh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Their motto was literally " A journey to literacy"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I swear that like, the high school education kids got 20-30 years ago is what you get in fucking community college now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The whole K-12 system might as well be daycare
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yesterday in my English 102 class was the first time I've ever done anything with shakespeare
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> b?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> prem ¤  SagaciousKJB ¤  Wanna spark one up?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> dude I had to go to kankakee for a while and it was an all black school besides the 5 of us and I shit you not the math book I had sophomore year was the exact same one I had in 5th grade
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol I believe it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's like one of the biggest reasons I dropped out of high school, they were teaching shit like pronouns and verbs in the HONORS english class, whatever that means
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude, I was in the normal science class, and because I could define density and buoyancy they were like, "Hmm, you should probably be in the honors classes"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah wtf were they teaching to the younger kids
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Pretty much nothing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I mean I hate to say it, but...  When you have class sizes of like 30 or more, and half of them don't speak English, not a very effective system.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> like my friends with kids all brag that their kids are on honor roll I'm just like all kids are on honor roll these days
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean they spoke English, but you know it's like with 30 kids already, just that extra time to get over accent and shit adds up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> how bou dah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> We usually had like translators and shit sitting in with kids who like, spoke broken English
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> fortunatly the mexican invasion was before my time
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> we had 2 that spoke spanish but we helped them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well at times
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> usually we were there to make it worse lolol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> pore george
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I took Spanish thinking it would be a good thing to learn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> poor*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> All the Mexicans in the class were like "Wtf is this?"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> probably was
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Because aparentliy Spanish from Spain is like, way different from Spanish from Mexico
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Or like, migrant-class Mexican spanish I guess is really what it is that no one wants to say.  The teacher was like, "In Mexico city they speak this dialect"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I usually tell people that want to learn spanish to learn something like japanese or some other 1st world country language
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> He went to some fancy ass university down there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I'm just like ok you can say do you want fries with that in spanish or make a trade deal in japanese
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ugh japanese was terrible
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> No wonder those people kill themselves so much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah the thing about bilingual stuff is that here a lot of places aren't hiring people who aren't bilingual
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> trump is working on that lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And so then in the meantime all the clerical and receptionist type jobs and stuff like that are being filled by the ones who are
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah but I really don't think these ones are illegal
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> still though he's probably working on that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah wouldn't doubt it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know man, I feel like if they went to school and got the degrees then they earned it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But that's when people bring up like, the supposed scholarships they can get
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Which I gotta say dude, you can get a scholarship for so much shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> white man can't get shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> There's left-handed scholarships lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> if you are black or anything else but white
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Nah if you're white and have had bad shit happen to your or done bad shit to other people you can get them too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So basically like, anyone that has grown up in a normal life is like, not deserving of free money I guess lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Really makes you wonder what the point of people acting good is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> back when I played wow we had a white guy from africa in our guild and he was filling out an ap and asked if he should check white or african american and I told him african american and he got the job
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah but what was his name?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> theo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> he's on my friends list on fb
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well did he list South Africa as his POB?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> theo mavro if you want to look him up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> mavaro*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah see I was gonna use the excuse he probably had a white name so they thought he was a british from South Africa lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah but most people are to stupid to know south africa is mostly white
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude I don't know shit about SA really, apart from like, apartheid and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> his actual name is like super long
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I saw this rap group from there...  Tweaker rap man
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Die Antwood or something like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It was bizarre, I saw them on Kimmel except I DVR it so it was like 5 am in the morning
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Looked like some teletubbies throwing an acid rave
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Seriously though I think black people would do themselvs a huge favor if htey stopped giving their kids dumb ass names
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Because if it comes down to an applicant named Shaquanda versus one named Betty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah got a black friend on fb and his name is ste'von
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I mean I'm sorry but I just don't really know a lot of level headed Shaquandas. 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The world already has enough opposition, why fuck your kid from the getgo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's like dude your name is stevon
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol I'd get that shit changed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Just look at the judge like, "Seriously man, you know how hard it is to get a job when you spell Steven like this?"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah he's a trump supporter too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> There was a girl in one of my classes last quarter named Emotion
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I was just like...  I wasn't even prepared for the spelling though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> this dude has his head on straight too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> he wears beastie boys shirts for fuck sakes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .bang
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I told him if trump gets elected he needs to hide that shirt otherwise they'll think he's a hatian that doesn't understand black culture yet
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Just keep an NWA shirt over it in certain areas lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> indeed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that dude can cook some shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> he went to a cordon bleu school and man he makes a mad prime rib
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> ...makes me hungry
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> poor guy has a job selling appliances though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's not that bad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Easier than selling some things
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah but he's got skills in the kitchen and could be making more
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I mean he could sell crack
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> plus he loves to cook
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well once Trump deports all the cooks the restraunts will be looking
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> can't get a job there because of all the mexicans in the kitchens around here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> hell yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol I like how youd idn't even need to explain it to me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> plus my landscaping should soar too lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ohhh I see why you been buying mowers now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> oh I've been doing this shit for years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> kinda
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I took a break to fix pc's when the recession hit because mexicans were killing me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but pc repair took a dive because everyone has cellphones and tablets now mostly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Fixing pc's sucks anyway lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah good money though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Not as cheap as people are here lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> and not busting balls in the sun all day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that's a plus
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> stepping in dog shit sucks too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> People are kind of stupid here though they'd rather go take it to a shop and get charged $100 for them to run a spyare remover
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but yeah when the work is good it's easy to make a grand a day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> "Oh well they're professionals they know what they're doing" lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> die antwoord is performance art. they're personas
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know though man it's not really going to be as great as everyone thinks...  I mean around here, the warehouses are pretty much 90% migrant labor.  There's going to be a huge work shortage
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> oh yeah the other reason why I got back into mowing was I got tired of people bringing their shit to best buy and getting charged $300 then best buy did nothing to it then they wanted me to fix it for $20
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> CaliGangstar, is their persona's crazy ass metheads? Because they nailed it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah I got shit canned from sears in the 90s due to mexicans
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> and the dude in die antwoord is actually really fuckin talented
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I thought it sounded good despite not being able to understand a word of it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But that chick gaves me nightmares
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they fired 200 of us and brought in 300 mexicans from delano california
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I just think food prices are going to end up going way up because of it.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well depends
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well around here, the migrant workers still make decent wages becaue of the competition, but they don't get any insurance or anything
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> depends on the type of food and where it came from in the first place
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> most shit grown here goes somewhere else anyway grian wise
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> potatoes will go up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh yeah well we're pretty agriculturally based so a lot of stuff is local
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> not as much as you'd think
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well depending on how honest they all are, but the stores make a big deal about local shit here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THey put big ass stickers on them "I'm local" like I actually give a fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> SagaciousKJB you should see Chappie
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> there is a ton of shit that we grow that just gets shipped to other countries anyway and we just get the left overs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Chappie?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/?ref_=nv_sr_1
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah most of our apples go to like Egypt and Japan
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> if we just ate what we grew food would be expensive but since so much is sold to other places it brings out cost way down
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> our*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> CaliGangstar, why haven't I heard of this before? Looks good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> or I should say if we just grew what we ate
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well one thing for sure is beer prices is gonna go up lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> We produce 80% of the hopps for the U.S.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> i dunno man, it's directed by the dude who made district 9 and shit. pretty popular movie
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah but that is all gathered by machines
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Not here lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> but die antwoord are in it and play themselves
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know if they harvest by machines but I know that all the Mexicans I worked with in the pot fields came straight from hop fields lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> here there is a place called hoekstras and they grow potatoes and shit like that and the mexicans pick that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I liked District 9 CaliGangstar 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> also our food quality will go back up too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ever get fries or potato chips?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Nahhhh I got this fat eating salad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they are shit now and full of brown spots because mexicans just toss whatever into the truck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol I can imagine them picking out dog turds
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the boss can yell at them till they are blue in the face but they don't understand wtf he's saying
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> hell they leave those in there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they don't give a fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah they don't actually care even if they do listen lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> if they get fired they just go up the road and work for the next guy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> We did like a lot of trimming stuff, not like, trimming buds but pruning type shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but here's the thing if we ship all the mexicans back everybody is crying "who will pick the crops?"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They'd basically just cut every living thing off the plant lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It was stupid too because I would like, stay behind and clean up their shit work so it actually ended up making me look slow
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but trump wants to get these fucks that are bleeding the welfare system dry and get them jobs and there is plenty of them to replace the mexicans
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's all about LOOKING like you're working hard
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Like they would strategize how to like, move from one plant to plant fast enough that it looked like they were at a good pace, but slow enough so they still got more hours out of the whole job
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> those dudes will have no choice but to keep their job
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yup they do that shit everywhere
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> like at sears I noticed when I'd go into the store shelves are empty and the merchandise is all banged up and beat up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> we would have been hung for shit like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but it's ok because they don't speak that language and don't understand
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> my ass...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> look at sears and kmart now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well if you can find one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They just closed the kmart here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> people bitch about walmart but hey you don't see mexicans working there and shit is in stock and in good shape
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They work in the auto center
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah they don't treat their workers well but they still have a job
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah I can tell
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that is why my moms car pulls way to the right now after it just got new tires
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh man I bought my new tires last week and fucking, asshole behind the counter rings up all the shit and gives me a total like wayyyy fucking higher than it should be
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I got quoted for like $741 and he rang it up to 928
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the mexicans are like it's allignment but no had it alligned twice and both guys said it's a radial pull from the tires they even switched them and it pulled to the other side now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So like 15 minutes later he's like, "Ohhh I see what happened" lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> walmart wouldn't do shit because the lazy mexican said it's alignment
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I was like fuck taking it to walmart lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but hey we got them on sale for $33 each
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's pretty good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I just spent like $100 a piece on mine
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah bitching to walmart is pointless
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But they are like pretty much the best all-around all season available
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> 75k treadwear warranty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ugh I gotta get 3 more for my trailer those pricks are 155 each
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> damn 10 ply tires
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh yeah you were talking about those
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah man I'm sure I could have got a real cheap all season from wally world but I said fuck it and treated it like an investment
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Hopefully I don't have to buy new ones for quite a while
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> these I can only get at discount tire
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THe last ones still had plenty of tread I just ended up getting one unevenly worn from a bad alignment
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> took a few years before I even found them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh yeah, these are hella common
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> these are a 14.5 inch rim
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Which I'm kind of happy about because if one blows out it shouldn't be too hard to get a replacement
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol That' a pain of a size
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah really
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> 2 of mine were car tires that somebody slapped on there 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I'm still wondering wtf car had a 14.5 inch rim
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Some foreign pos with a metric that happened to fit right I bet
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> must have been a yugo or some shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> !calc 14.5 * 25.4
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Answer is ( 368.3 )
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Still kind of an odd figure in metric too lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah it says 14.5 on the side though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's kind of a small rim size isn't it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well in the 80s and early 90s 13 and 14 inch rims were common
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> like your compact hatchbacks had those
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that's what I remember seeing them on a lot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well smaller wheels I mean
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> LIttle early 90s hondas and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ford festivas had 13 inch rims
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Never even heard of that model lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> and the lug pattern was the same as my polaris quad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> oh yeah man they were pretty popular but didn't last long
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they were smaller than an escort
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol geo metro size?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they still make them in other countries they are called the fiesta there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah pretty close
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Festiva
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> scroll down to first gen
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but look how tiny the rims and tires are lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Still loading lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You watch oak island tonight?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> naw not yet
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Okay never seen those

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I had to kill it in task manager
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> my fire fox constantly crashes

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I use an extention to download the stream
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I'll just go make some food while it dicks around

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ive been reading the game of thrones books and theyre so rad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i still havent watched game of thrones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> been meaning to get onto it along with a bunch of other shows
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i've gotta force myself to get into fantasy even though i generally end up liking whatever it is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> took me until the extended cuts of lord of the rings to come out to give it a proper go
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i've heard game of thrones is one of the best shows but its one of those things
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i go hard on sci fi
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> you need to start it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its fuckin unreal good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no doubt, my boy is always telling me shit about it every week when its on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it definitely sounds dope and comes highly recommended
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the books are choice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no doubt, i think thats pretty undisputed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> motherfucker goes hard
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the last thing i ended up reading was the martian
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> b?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha ¤  prem ¤  Wanna spark one up?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> kinda put me off for a while there, i wasnt digging it at all
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the movie was pretty good though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i read that too!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that book was amazing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> heres the thing, i appreciated the detail and those are the things that made the movie dope
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the author Andy Weir used to work at Blizzard
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think that book really showed me why i love short stories
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> whatbdo you mean
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh word? thats pretty dope
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> s/bdo/ do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i guess im not a fan of extreme details. i tried to read the lord of the rings a while back and couldnt really get down with it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Tolkien has kind of a weird style to be fair, though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> with short stories, you get quick world building and get straight to the plot, dialog and point
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it's kind of why i compared the martian and the lord of the rings
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they're both a little different to most shit in terms of style and details
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ok if you like a story that is a blast, ready Ready Player One by Ernest Cline
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> one of my favorite books
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word, ive been meaning to get onto that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its an adventure story
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ah so you know
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah for sure, the internets loves that one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im down with 80s & 90s nostalgia
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i generally only read sci fi and short stories
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> and sci fi manga
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> but yeah, i naturally watch a fuck load more than i read. i more so love longer books / series for what they can bring to the screen and not so much actually reading them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> well honestly it should be your top priority in all entertainment to read that book
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its your fuckin wheel house bro
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its a fast read
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> amazing references throughout
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha for real, it definitely sounds perfect for me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> now that you recc'd it personally, im gonna have to get onto it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> have you heard of heavy metal - the magazine? heavy metal 2000 the movie is based on some of the stories
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its got editions from the 70s-2000s. all tripped out short stories, graphic novels and comics
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nope
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive been making my way through them on and off for the past couple of years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i never got into heavy metal
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> .bef
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :"O

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Before I hit send, make sure you have nothing to add to this
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Unless you're throwing a $100 stylus on it, it is going to rip the shit out of your records in a week tops. See: Crosley. Also, a lack of adjustable tracking weight will lessen that life expetency. Point being, don't trust a portable turntable or a crosley with your life.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaga

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> thats been everyone as a whole
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> ive stopped arguing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> its just not worth spiking my blood pressure
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> The post earlier was something like "I don't give a fuck about gays, they don't affect my daily life"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Dude your nephew is gay
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> woooow
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Now he's on "I see all these breast cancer foundations, but where are the ones for men?"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i can only facepalm so hard bro

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Too many benzos to get angry
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> yeah i can feel that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> the great equalizer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Only 3mg but still
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I get my 3mg a day

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> yep

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> He's not even like full on MRA but more just ignorant republican

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol truth
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> somebody just called me a libertarian...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> shut up, batin'
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i saw that casey
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lmao do I come off as a libertarian?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i dont think id use that word to describe you

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i dont really know what word fits
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> but not that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol agreed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> been called a republican asshole lots
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i think people just love throwing classifying words around
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> back in the day it was like commies and pinkos and shit like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> now its just taken a different form
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ah a simpler time
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Terrorist and thug are the new commie and pinko
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> people like to seperate themselves from what they dont agree with
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> and this is how they do it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> yep
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I just say niggers to keep it nice and simple
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You know what though I really think the conservatives have the name calling thing down over liberals.  They got libtard going but liberals don't have shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And cuntservative is so obvious
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I like demotwats myself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Haven't heard that one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> A demo twat sounds like a fake pussy floor model in a toy shop lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> "Don't forget to swab out the demotwat"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> haha nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I usually use use a long A when I say it so it's closer to democrat
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> err short A I mean
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I wonder what Democrat sounds like in a Boston accent
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They're wicked progressive
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ahaha

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> my god that democrat said that calling the feds into chicago is a tenuous argument and those cases will get thrown out of court *throws hands up*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't think the feds need to be called in. Their murder rate has been this high or higher before and it went back down
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't know what that the line is where you say 'that's enough'
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> no it's way up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> It's the highest its been in 19 years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> and getting higher
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's not just the murder rate either
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> there has been 224 shootings this year
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> aye, saw that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I think Finn is my favorite member of CA chat
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> http://imgur.com/a/w2eoD
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Look how cute he is!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> He's like 6 months old
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Also highest its been in 19yrs sure
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But what about the mid 80s?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> When crack was in full swing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Totally irrelevant
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I'm just curious how high it was then
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Thought you wanted smaller govt Casey. Why can't Chicago boot out the leadership and vote in people who solve problems?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> instead of asking the nanny state to swoop in
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nanny fed, more like*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> because it's the ones commiting the crimes voting them in
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The criminals do not outnumber the normal people
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> People just need to go vote
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yes they do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol no, they don't
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol come to chicago bud
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> chicago may have a lot of criminals, but there are not more people shooting than being shot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Like literally, it's not statistically possible
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> All hyperbole aside
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> All in the game, yo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Sounds like a lazy bunch of voters
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol if you drew a line south of I80 illinois crime rate would be nill
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> is that like your 8 Mile
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> mom's spaghetti
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> chicago out populates the rest of the state
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha prem SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> chicago dictates everything here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I find it funny that a place called Urbana doesn't have a super high crime rate
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol fucking urbana
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that place...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah and it sounds like the people of Chicago aren't picking leaders who will solve any of the problems
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the city itself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's mostly a college town
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I just looked at my map to see were I80 is 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> not the rest of IL
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> And Urbana stuck out lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> you can get a dui there riding passenger
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> which is surprising because typically old white people are the only ones who vote in city elections
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> hey now i vote in city elections
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> so you'd think they would be all about crime prevention
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they do and vote that way but chicago beats them out everytime
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm talking about Chicago
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> only Chicago
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> where all the crime is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> dude chicago is full of black people
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> No crime in say, Peoria?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Just curious
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I know nothing about IL lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> naw peroria is pretty rough
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Yeah but that doesn't change the fact that mostly just old white people vote in city elections
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like nationwide, except in rare super trendy college towns like Austin or Portland
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> not here lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> here it's all hippies and tech nerds
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Austin is mostly white
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> dude take a trip to here you'll only need one ticket
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> you won't go home
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well in a box maybe
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> if they find the corpse
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> If you're in like Wrigleyville you're safe
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But that's all I know
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I lived in Houston for a very long time. I know what it's like to live in an unsafe area 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> don't need to visit Chicago for that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well wrigleyville is full of gays
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> They had the Dead 50th anniversary shows there, only reason I know this
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it's part of why I moved away from there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> That noise shows like every week
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> where eggbot :O
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah chicago is worse than houston
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Where that footage was from last year
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> oh gotcha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yes, it is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> no one disputes that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> chicago is worse than detroit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> fucking DETROIT
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> They only ever show you the bad parts of Detroit.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> There's plenty of areas of D that aren't like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Downtown is like a thriving art community
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah but most of chicago IS like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I believe it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Detroit still tops most crime rate charts
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> hell kankakee here looks like those areas in detroit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Chicago gets the press because of their size
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the volume numbers outweigh Detroit's but the crime-per-citizen rate is not as high as Detroit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> crime per resident I should say
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well chicago is hard to count like that too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> St Louis, Oakland, and Memphis are all really bad too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> in terms of rate
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> as metroplexes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like East St Louis is a burrough and it has one of the highest rates in the entire country, but like 5 miles away is whiteville
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the city of chicago is small it's the outer parts that are really fucked
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but St Louis as a whole metro has a terrible crime rate, nationally
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Houston used to be way worse but the last decade has been much better
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> you gotta add up all the shit in those cities and counties and then you might get a number maybe
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Houston used to have a lot of stabbings, weirdly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> .bang
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> like chicago you gotta put a pin in the map and draw a 60 mile circle around that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Buddha, it's hard to hold a gun all the way up on some drank
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> gary indiana and all that shit falls in there too

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Gary Indiana is one of the places that thinks all the factory jobs are going to come back like it's 1971

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yep, some dick came and cut the cord and snatched the cam
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I'm trying to see if I can avoid buying a new cord lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah they are pretty firgiving signal wise
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> o*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah and what's worse is the piece of shit video quality is so bad I wouldn't be able to recognize them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So, yeah, I am thinking about mounting it inside
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> mine is just an rca spliced to an old bnc network cable
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Major reason I had it where it was, is so I could make a zoneminder zone on my window and get motion sensing alerts
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh yeah I had to rig something like that up to get the DVR that does the recording to send the signal to my PC's capture card
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Was going to get a 4-input capture until I found out only 1 channel can operate at a time
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I have an old 24hr vcr but it's not hooked up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The new power over ethernet IPCams look awesome, but I don't really feel like spending the money on one to have it ripped off.  Frankly I was basically counting down until that happened lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> main reason it's not the damn crt monitor got knocked off and ripped the coax cables right out the back
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Whoops lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> monitor was fine except the power button doesn't stay pushed in anymore
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's an old green monochrome one 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> looks pretty 80s scifi
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Right, yeah whenever the night vision on mine go on it looks black and white
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And so grainy that it looks like it could be an 80s security camera
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But like, a really good one haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah my cam is old as dirt it's b&w anyway
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> plus the sun has to be shining directly on something to see it

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah new ones have all that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> cheap too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah, well I mean, relative.  The one they ripped off was $10 lol
