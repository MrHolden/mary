[GhostNetwork:#theden] <Buddha> .beer bud light
[GhostNetwork:#theden] <pig> (Buddha) Beer: Bud Light, Style: American-Style Light (Low Calorie) Lager, ABV: 4.2, Availability: Year Round, Details: Introduced nationally in 1982, Bud Light is brewed using a blend of domestic and imported hops as well as a combination of barley malts and rice.  It contains more malt and hops by ratio of ingredients than Budweiser, which gives the brew a distinctively clean and crisp taste.

[GhostNetwork:#theden] <Buddha> .beer dos equis amber
[GhostNetwork:#theden] <pig> (Buddha) Beer: Dos Equis Amber, Style: Vienna-Style Lager, ABV: 4.7, Availability: Year Round, Details: A robust, classic Vienna-style lager with a full body. A beer with brawn from Germany, swagger from Mexico, and the finest North American pale and roasted malts. An amber-colored refreshment that’s adventurous enough to be distinctly flavorful. A hot-blooded redhead that’s best enjoyed ice-cold.
