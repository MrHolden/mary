[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That could be anything
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> nah it's legit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Hot knives or burn it on top of some cigarette ash
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But you gotta drop it onto the knives
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ricky, you know i can't smoke hot knives
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> that's probably the best way to go though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> definitely wax though, we tried some last night lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Depends on how much of it you got
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> i'm no good at gauging that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Burning it kind of wastes it but I mean, it's so much easier and convenient lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You can even put little dabs of it on the ends of your smokes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> yeah it's definitely a waste but if it's all i got

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> im a purist though, i only use honey dutchmasters
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Use to be fair I still had mine
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> its what i learned on, and never failed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> eggbot++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah like me and randy's
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> yep, these kids try using backwoods and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> and its not bad, its just...not the same
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah had one of those new black and milds the other day and I was like this is cheating
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> black and milds are to be used after the weed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> not with the weed imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Someone do that is great vid imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i got into a fistfight in a strip club one time over a black and mild
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I can see that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> dude was smoking it in the viewing area
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i told him put it out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> he told me to fuck myself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> time to stomp skull
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> and i dragged him outside infront of his boys and all
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> they wanted no part of it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i mean, cowboy killers and niggerports are bad enough
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> but black and milds are just obnoxious
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> now if were a captain black it'd be diferent
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> captain black anything smells good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> got a pouch and my pipe to the left of me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * GhostofCT fires up ye old briar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> right on, never had it, but sometimes the pipe is the way to go, i like how slow it burns and its an enjoyable flow
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i saw a pic of some chicken and waffles blunt wraps
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> just none of that overdried "tobacco" shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> only thing I don't like is when you take a drink while smoking one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> damn they know their audience Buddha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol true
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that black and mild I was talking about was grape soda flavored I shit you not
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> say what?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> seriously
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> i usually just get a wine wood tip and call it good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> grade soda whaaaat
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> s/rad/rap
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Neo> haha
