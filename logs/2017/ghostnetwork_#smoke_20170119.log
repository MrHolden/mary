[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that kinda night
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Got pizza hut on the way lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I was hoping to hotbox this shit by the time they got here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> what did you order
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Two medium pizzas, with garlic and parmeasean sauce, pepperoni, and buffalo suace drizzled on them, and then 16 buffalo wings
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> why so much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Only way to get a good deal lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'll probably eat the wings and save most of the pizza for tomorrow
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THey had this "big dinner box" meal promo so I got it all for like $25
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Their wings are pricey
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> you can get four digiornos, a bottle of buffalo sauce and two dozen precooked (or uncooked) wings at the store for that much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> A bottle cap
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah but it's their sauce that really makes the difference
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> All I can find at the store is frank's and it's not the same at all
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> fuck franks
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> franks--
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah not a big fan
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Whatever buffalo sauce they use is from wing street
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> If I could just buy the sauce I'd totally be cooking my own
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But on the plus side they do a pretty good job cooking the chicken
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> pizza hut does a decent job with their wings
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I mean to be fair it's really not worth the money still but meh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm sick of being responsibile today
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Gave up pussy to do homework

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Hunts brand?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> hunt's snack pack
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Those aren't the most robust flavor profile
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah these are better because of that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well to me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the jello ones are super sweet
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm not a big jello fan
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it's all sugar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> everything they do is all sugar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha GhostofCT SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> and that is why we have an obesity problem
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> jello has banana creme pie ones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I just want to perch by the display and smack somebody when they pick one up and say you don't need instant pie fatty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lots of weird shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like how Trident has dessert flavored gum
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> there's an apple pie one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> a cheesecake one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> a chocolate minut
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> s/ut/t
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah for fat fucks inbetween cheesecakes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> fat fucks can't go 5 mins without the taste of cheesecake
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> seriously
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man all I saw was cheesecake and now I hate you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> see?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm not a cheesecake guy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> My sweet tooth is almost always for chocolate.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> me either
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THey make chocolate cheesecake
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I mean I like apple pie and various cobblers but do I need it in gum form?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well if you're anorexic
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And you miss tasting things
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> cheesecake is way too rick but if it's not rich it tastes like ass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> now cheese danish I like because it's just enough to be good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The thing about cheesecake is it's a really regional thing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> New York Cheese Cake is the best
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Isn't that just regular cheesecake
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They don't use a shitload of sour cream
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> al bundy will argue you there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .g difference between cheesecake and new york cheesecake
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ah heavy cream
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I do'nt know, maybe it's just a thing here, because there's some that are mostly like sour cream based and not as good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Fuck tetris
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> there is sour cream in there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> wb laz
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> 97 lines, make one false move and I'm done
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> tetris--
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah I found my game boy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> no spaceship for you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I had one where like the whole top layer was sour cream it was weird
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> og gameboy?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Color, but I do still have the grey brick somewhere
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah I always wondered what made a cheesecake a new york cheesecake
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> my first gameboy was a color
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> had a purple one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> probably made by a jew
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Damn the police sure are circling around here quite a bit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Mine's the teal/blue/whatever one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> My first game boy was a game boy pocket
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> mine is ye old gray brick
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I inherited the brick from my brother but *my* first one was this color
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it has the bad speaker so you know it's first gen lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I do'nt remember if mine ws color
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't think I had any color games if it was
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> The speaker appears to be broken on this GB
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> :(
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I wanted to hear the tetris music. Like I cant just grab the keyboard and play it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aw damn I thought they fixed that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I had a purple GBC with Pokemon Blue
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I had killer instict on the gameboy and I always wanted the supergameboy cartridge adapter for my super nes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> no headphone jack?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I had the black SNES cartridge for KI
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Until I realized they had killer instict on the super nes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> with the CD sountrack
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Killer Kuts
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Damn that sounds nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .yt killer kuts
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> fuck yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I never got to play it much though, some black kid down the street owned it and his dad wouldn't let him hang out with white kids lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Fuckign reverse racism over here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> KI was my shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Love the skeleton guy, forgot the name
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> shit I have rob from my nes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Fuck now I wanna play KI
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I had ki on sega
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I didn't know it was on sega
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> My buddy still had his power glove for the longest time
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The only sega system I ever owned was a dreamcast
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it first came out on sega I think
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I was a nintendo kid
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> still have a dc too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> fishing?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah sega was cool but I pretty much had whatever my dad bought lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I had to buy mine
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> bought mine from some poor kid and it was probably stolen
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> My dad played our nintendo more than we did lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I got the atari, comodore 64 and the nes as christmas presents
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well, he got further into the games anyway
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> my dad had no interest in them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I got N64 as a christmas present in 99
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Then I was like, "Oh crap, Y2k? I better get to playing this shit"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol in 99 I bought one at sears on a credit card
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> and was 23 lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THey had credit cards in 99?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> :P
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> watch it boy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have some picture of me at 11 with the thing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think I was 11, can't really remember
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> 99-88 but always gotta round it down, so no I guess I just turned 10
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know, having a december birthday makes subtracting from the year to find the age a pain in the ass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> at 10 I had a kaypro computer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> When I was really young we had a Texas Instruments Colecovision
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> We had a Windows 95 computer I think
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> we didn't have hard drives we had a dos floppy and we liked it!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I played with paint a lot lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The Colecovision is the first console we ever owned
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> haha yeah our first computer had a 5.25" floppy drive
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> 64kb of ram
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ours had a Turbo button
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> No idea what it actually did, if anything
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I got one of those at a garage sale didn't much care for the coleco
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> They don't care about genres
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah the turbo was pointless
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I remember finding a 2400 bps modem in my grandpas stuff when he died
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The Coleco we had came with some mouse hunt game
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> with cats
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and blocks of cheese
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I forget
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I had a 386 with the turbo and it even had a read out on the front that showed the processor and it cut it down to half when it wasn't on but I saw no difference
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the intellivision was where it was at
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I liked that more than my atari
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> only thing that sucked was the controllers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I remember trying to play a playstation once and like, it had tomb raider on it...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Got nowhere with that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> a they were weird and they had the old phone cord type cords that would pull out of your hand soon as it got sweatty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I had tomb raider on my pc
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wow didn't know they had it on the pc
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I think win 98 even
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> still using that keyboard
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> hell this keyboard was 11 years old then
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I need to throw it a party in march that is when it turns 30
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> My oldest one just died
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> this thing is a trooper
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> if it ever dies I'm framing it and hanging it on the wall
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> SOme day geologists will find it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> no doubt there lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I typed on mine so much that most of the keys were literally worn smooth
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that is why my shift sticks
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Read that as shirt at first lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's not full of gunk it's just wore so smooth the thing just doesn't return
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but dude all the letters on this still look like day 1
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well minus the few key caps that are missing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> missing page up, f11 and right ctrl
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .bang
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well windows key too but it never had one lolol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Did windows even exist
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> nope
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Shit how old is windows?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> older than 87
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> err younger
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah 'cause I was thinking of like Windows 3.1 as like, well, the first Windows
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the ps2 had dos and not even msdos
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> used to play the fuck out of some karateka on this beast when it was new
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Never heard of that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .g windows version 1
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> wow 1985
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well that wasn't public though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well let me rephrase that nobody hardly had it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> we were all still using dos then
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> win 3.11 was the first one to spread
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> When the digital world got herpes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> 1.0 was just a proof of concept and nothing much more really
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it was still easier to command line everything
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> really windows slowed you down
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I remember a friends dad showing me one of the first windows and I was like k now what? lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> back then we were still loading disks and windows was just another disk to load
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> omg my gameshark still works too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> yas
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I've gotten pretty use to the command line on linux now that i kind of get irritated having to click something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I have a gameshark somewhere but no idea whatever happened to the book
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> had a gameshark on the dreamcast too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> only game I used it for was resident evil 3 for unlimited chain gun
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> still the best game for mowing down zombies imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Gameshark on the n64 was awesome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that chain gun sounded great too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> only had a few games for the 64
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I had mostly wrestling games
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> goldeneye ofcourse and a wrestling game
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh and goldeneye lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> WCW vs nWo World Tour?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> WCW vs nWo Revenge?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> No I had the WWF ones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Didn't like WCW
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> hmm don't remember
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh I had an ECW one too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> WCW was for bitches
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> WWF Monday Night Raw I think was the 64 one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I remember you could make your own toon
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * Laz starts an E-C-DUB chant
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that one had a complex move system
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the WCW games were fucking AWESOME
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that was super early though, they had Wrestlemania 2000 and No Mercy too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> some of the best wrestling games EVER made
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> No Mercy was the best
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ^
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Sag knows what's up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Y'all.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> SagaciousKJB++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> for once
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Use to hack the hell out of No Mercy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .mc wcw nwo revenge
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .metacritic wcw vs nwo revenge
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Somehow figured out how ot make hell in the cell matches
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> COME ON
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You know I think I vaguely remember it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I don't remember playing it much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The gameplay was so different from the wwf ones I didn't like it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Gonna grab an N64 emulator tonight
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> good luck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> most are shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah you need like a quad core to emulate a n64 game well too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah and they are still buggy usually
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Weird
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> DC emulators work just fine
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .g wcw nwo revenge reviews
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> there is a free goldeneye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Man, so long ago there's not even a metacritic score
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .g metacritic wcw nwo revenge n64
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's called goldeneye source or some shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Playstation and DC emulators are usually good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> PS2 and N64 emulators are crap
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah I finished both Shenmue and Jet Set Radio on DCNull just fine
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah the jap consoles are a real bitch with emu
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I will say Wrestlemania 2000 was amazing and it was on n64
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and it was made by THQ who made both the WCW games I mentioned
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> which is why it rocked
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> n64 had some good stuff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I spent like four hours making a wrestler
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah Wrestlemani 2000 was great.  No Mercy was basically that but with more stuff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> No Mercy was better than WM2000 imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Weapons, match modes, characters, etc.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Sup even better imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> fuck off eggbot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> nobody asked you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> The plant itself and so far off that myself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah the create a wrestler shit was awesome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude with the gameshark you could make custom moves
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I think that was the one I had
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but you could do custom moves
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't think I played No Mercy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> did you ever play Blast Corps?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> all you needed was goldbergs spear though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Goldberg was fucking goku in that game
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> in Wrestlemania 2000 at least
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Why would goldberg be in a WWF game tho
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah all my friends were pissed and blamed me for making some super char but all I had was his spear 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ah yaeh must have been wcw
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> must've been
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> so long ago
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .g wcw nwo revenge n64 AND goldberg
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> H5 come school these fuckers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aye lots of drugs since then
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> fuck what was that one game
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> sec
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but yeah goldberg was like goku or stryker with that damn baton and grenade move
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> baton grab grenade baton grab grenade win
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I know someone that claims he sold Goldberg coke
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> also Scott Norton was insanely good in WCW NWO World Tour despite being a sack of dick garbage IRL
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Fire Pro wrestling!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> just throw haymakers all day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> That game was dope.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol wtf they remade karateka
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I remmber there was an ECW wresting game
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yep
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The gamepay wasn't very good but like, they had all the crazy shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Barbed wire matches and stuff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> oof
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> what was that game that was supposed to be a big deal in the mid late 90s, like an arena fighting game with insane brutality and gore. I think it was pulled from shelves or canceled at the last minute, but it had a whole bunch of hype
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think I had to get my mom to buy me that one because of the rating lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> here sag this is karateka https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKqk9kosCs4
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> was it Thrill Kill?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I remember reading about it in GamePro or something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Mutant League Football? lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol THose graphics aren't as bad as I expected GhostofCT 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah mine was monochrome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah it was Thrill Kill https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrill_Kill
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .w thrill kill
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> While the technical feat of allowing four players to fight simultaneously in the same room was to be a major selling point, this was overshadowed by the controversy surrounding the game's depictions of violence and sexual content. Examples of this content include BDSM and fetishistic costumes and acts, limb dismemberment, and violent special moves with suggestive names such as "Bitch Slap" and "Swallow This"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .bef
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that game sounded awesome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> watching this kinda makes me want to play carmen sandiego
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Play oregon trail
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The only place Carmen San Diego needs to be is on my dick
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Sag did you ever play Organ Trail?

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Had to water plants
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I looked away for seconds
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> :>
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> happy little trees 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I wish
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They're all fucked up right now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :(
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I should have bought new soil but instead I just reused the same stuff I've used through two cycles lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> whats wrong with those motherfuckers?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ahhhhhh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They're starving, and I'm not sure why because whenever I give them nutrients they get burned
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah that can fuck with you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm thinking the soil is just no good anymore
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> PH is right but I'm wondering if it's too compacted and the roots aren't getting enough oxygen
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It doesn't help that I just topped and FIM'd them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Buddha, what is the charge? shooting a duck?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well, first fim, but only did one right, so topped them lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ..|.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> FIM? Give em the FYM next time.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * SagaciousKJB watches the joke fly over his head
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> fuck y'all motherfuckers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i dont know how well it works for bud, but you could try watering down the nutrients a bit and give them less at more regular intivals
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well the problem is with weed you gotta let the roots dry out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They don't like to stay wet all the time
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I need to start using real soil
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> This shit pretty much had no nutrients in it from the start
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha true that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> you definitely want your shit to be alive and healthy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well it was at leats living soil
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah, NPK of like, nothing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I actualy had to go hunt down the number from some forum where someone had it analyzed lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I do'nt know, I'm figuring they'll pull out of it once they get further into veg
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They're still really young
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the beauty of my 3 year old pepper plants is that i dont have to worry about leaf burn anymore
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Just eats up all the nutrients huh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i heavily fertilize those cunts until they're leaves are dark green
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I have two strains, and one seems to be a lot more tempermental to the nutrients
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> pretty much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> This other one is a week behind in growth on the others and is eating up the same nutrients without getting burned at all
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they still get burned but it doesnt effect the yeild and they're not gonna really grow much bigger
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha Laz prem 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I would take a pic of mine right now but they look like garbage lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I am not as bummed now I planted them mid decemer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They got plenty of time lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's actually what screwed me up they say you're not supposed to give them any nutrients for like the first 3 weeks but they were getting too yellow
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think when you grow in depleted soil it pretty much turns into hydro
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> some of my tomatos are getting there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im kind of in the same situation, been using the same soil for a while and havent really been building on it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> now that im making my own soil/compost blend, it should be good though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I need to get some shit to lower the pH
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have some shit that my neighbor makes that I could amend with but it will screw up the pH
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> plus you can grow certain crops to return certain nutrients to the soil
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> prem: 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> not really
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> im doing web design now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well my space is limited so I can't really do that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats dope tec
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I was reading about the plan limit laws...  Aparently they count multiple stalks eminating from the same rootball as one plant.  So technically I could just put a flower bed in there, grow as many as I want, and just make sure it forms a massive rootball lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive been thinking about getting back into it for a while now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> prem: good moneyz
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> true that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> what are you using these days? some crazy java stack combos?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i got no idea where to even start
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> nah, just plain html5/css
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Prem, nah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> js
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> niiiiice

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> https://bestmotherfucking.website/
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think you'll appreciate it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> i hate overloaded websites

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> http://yolive.me/
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they look pretty in screenshots but they're basically tech demos for super computers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> yeah for example this one takes a long time to open a fucking preloader
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> and then you have to wait more
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Lol wait what
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it definitely looks nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> but i dont know that it needs to be 7mb
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> doom was what, 1mb?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> super mario bros was lke 25kb lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> super mario bros was 34kb

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> it looked so nice, i had to take it with me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Haha damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> nicely done
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> this is the same old shitty laptop i was using years ago

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no shit, im regretting wasting my money on an xbox one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thing is pure garbage
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its already become a chromecast/netflix box
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> haha i just bought a ps4
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> GOD DAMN IT
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> not you too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> everyone in here has a ps4
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> hahaha i love my ps4
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> my problem is, i burned through the 3 games i wanted to play in a week
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its just been sitting here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> my desktop is pretty good though, its just that i wanted a good video card and then i found i had to replace a bucnh of stuff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> what have you been playing recently?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> He's always come to school again recently
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> uncharted 4 and watch dogs 2
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ahhh yeah, that happened to me but it was like 5 years ago
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> yeah getting the ps4 was cheaper in some way
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> however you cant pirate games on ps4 :(
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So lately I've been screwing this chick, and it starts out with me giving her a full body massage, eating her out, and then fucking her.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I'm wondering...  Who is this really a happy ending for?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha yeah, ive been buying used games for like $5-10 for years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> this retail shit aint cool
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao You guys are like, "No comment" haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lmao sag
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> SagaciousKJB: i'd say both
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> nah im getting to it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> depends on how much you like eating pussy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> is gaming cheap in australia, prem 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> Would you say
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> but i mean, it definitely a two way street
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> dear god no dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> retail for most games i between $80-110
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> :O
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Well I love doing that, but with her it's more like, because I can't seem to last longer than 30 seconds inside of her haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> but i expect wages to be high as well
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hourly wage is min. $15
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> What's that in  USD
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> $2?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i donno
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .g AUD to USD
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> well thats really high man
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Stupid ass google
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .g AUD USD exchange rate
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> nah its probably around half, say $7.50
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> .g 1 aud in usd
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ahh that's better
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh shit, we're back up again
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh that's actually really close to min wage here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And we have the highest int he country
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> We have like $11 an hour minimum wage increase this year though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah, its been argued that we're relativly on point with the US but thats total bullshit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> yeah i have a friend in australia who's happy working in a restaurant serving food because his wage is waaaay higher there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> we dont have the economies of scale that you guys do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well it doesn't matter if the wages are similar if the goods all cost more
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lol no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> a can of coke is $3.50 at a corner store. cigarettes are $30. a bottle of vodka is at cheapest $22
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> omg
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And I know shit must cost a lot in Australia like, if it's not manufactured domestically, because anything we import from Australia is jacked up, so anything you guys import has to be too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> those are tax related but still
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> amazing wine here is like $5 aud
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> $30 for a pack of smokes is amazing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'd quit smoking
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I mean, I don't smoke
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> yeah crazy shit, its the same in Venezuela
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But if I did I would at those prices lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i tried
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> cigarettes are heavily taxed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Weed is pretty heavily taxed here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <tecnovm64> and their market is extremely restricted
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> 35% to the state and then a 8% sales tax on top of that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah you can pick up $8-10 bottle of wine
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man I wanna find those boxes of wine my grandma use to rock
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Shit comes with its own tap and everything
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I use to think that's what wine coolers were lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word, thats what i drink
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I just wanna bring them to a party sometime
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> http://www.goodgoonguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Sunnyvale_Fruity_Lexia_Dr_Pepper_Cherry-563x353.jpg
