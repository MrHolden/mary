[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha, they open. they're like security doors for your windows
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh that's good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i cant really find anything similar enough on google
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think I've seen em

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> feel like you might need a couple more straps there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol I was thinking that too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> My main goal though is just making it hard enough that they'd have to work long/hard enough to alert a neighbor
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The way they are it's pretty easy to just shove a window AC in and then bam, open window
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha definitely
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah I need more than 10 feet lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i had an old window box unit that fell out into the lounge room for no apparent reason one day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it definitely happens
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> this mixtape is dope af, prem
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the first one you linked
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> This summer one of the neighbors locked herself out while doing laundry and the landord wasn't gonna come let her in until like 3 day slater or some shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hell yeah, love that dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> check out volume 2 aswell, its even better imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> np: spank master
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Anyway, we were looking at ways to get in through the window and I was just like, "Push in the AC" and I was amazed how easy that was
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no kidding
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they're just basically balancing there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I mean some of them have some little screws but the stuff attaching the AC to the screws is all plastic
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah no kidding
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> mine was from the 80s so it should have been mounted with metal brackets and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Funny thing is I was just debating dropping more money on a better camera the other day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol One of those things that weighs as much as a TV
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> shit couldnt mount up against the ledge tho

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> my girl scout cookies look amazing but not quite this good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I've been thinking about sacrificing a bit to get it tested just to see what the THC percent is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no shit, it looks like its been rolled in icing sugar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> After all fucked up a bit myself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That shit is super potent and smells great, but it doesn't taste as good as the Blackberry Kush
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That stuff is just like...  Candy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> http://i.imgur.com/ESPK9wu.jpg
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ffffff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think i just saw the first stems id ever consider smoking
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man when these plants were growing the crystals were everywhere
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Stems, stalk, even fan leaves
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats glorious

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I made some firecrackers for this girl I've been seeing, and I also tried making some special rice crispies, but man edibles just don't do much for me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> dude not a huge smoker but he was fucked off his rocker for 10 hours
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well the leaves don't relaly give me a high when juiced into a milkshake
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But it helps my IBS

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I need to like, get my shit going again so I can get more leaves and do it more often
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I can't wait until Texas legalizes and I can grow my own plants
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Maybe by 2050 it will happen.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> !calc 2050-2017
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I just wash, rinse, bag them up, press, and then put them in the freezer. Then when I want some I break off a chunk off the frozen block
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Answer is ( 33 )
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha 33

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So yeah I am trying like hell to save these strains
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The guy I was getting the girl scout seeds from is a dick though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The blackberry kush was just bagseed lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> nothing wrong with that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive saved tons of rouge seeds from tasty strains ive gotten
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I've got a feminized Romulan seed like, in my vault waiting until I'm not a fuckup and can grow it well lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .g leafly Romulan
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that sounds legendary
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> strain names are the best
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I made some seeds with the Platinum Girl Scout Cookies and some Cherry OG, I'm gonna call it Princess Leia
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude weed growing is so crazy now compared to when I first started reading about it...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> prem we practiced some noise tonight
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> he's so doing my vocals
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> :')
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its so much fucking cooler, thats for sure
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> +too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You can make feminized seeds at home easy as shit now man
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :O
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im definitely years behind and 0 experience
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats legendary
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> but have you heard this mixtape you asked me about several times tho
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> what do you do? buy some goo and paste it onto the seeds?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ?pockettape
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> For some reason silver fucks up its hormones and makes it stress so bad that it turns the plant male
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> .yt peanut butter wolf
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> Buddha https://soundcloud.com/stylustbeats/stylust-beats-the-pocket-tape-pt2
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But because it's still a genetic female, if you use the pollen to pollinate any other female, the seeds it makes will always come out female because it was two females crossed together, so only Y chromosones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So you can buy collidal silver, which they sell at like suppliment and nutrition stores because people think it's a cure all, and then dose the plant with that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that sound dope tho laz
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i wanna get in on this with some turn table distortion pedal shit at some point. maybe album #3
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats amazing sag
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah it's like they've been working on this growing weed thing more than going to mars
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Fuckin' sciencing shit up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah my plan is to make enough seeds to never have to order them online
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> all it took was a couple of fucking years of legalisation
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> seriously
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Right, like, I'd say 2008 and the California med scene is when it all shifted
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> amsterdam, you had decades. get the fuck out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> fucking scrubs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I think it's still illegal to grow over there though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So they're still all underground-ish, because nobody actually gives a fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah they just don't enforce the laws
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its like a sanctuary city for weed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah theres definitely some funky shit going on there, cant quite remember the exact situation
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's almost like that here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I mean, I really don't remember the last grow I remember hearing bout being busted
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The government could make so much money by legalizing and regulating it. The only reason they don't, and I can't think of ANYTHING else, is that big pharma and big tobacco are monetarily blocking that from happening
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i wish they'd just focus on meth over here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean here, there was a big operation in NJ just the other day that got busted
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> by bribing politicians
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> or anywhere
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the city is hurting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha Laz prem SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no doubt Buddha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The FDA and DEA are actually so brokenly linked together that it's pretty much proveable that is the case
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> plus, a fuck ton of 3 agencies, cops, fuccboi anti drug groups would lose their funding
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> *3 letter agencies
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The NIDA and ODNCP are pretty bad too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But they're mostly about gutter science
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> AN1 is the best 3 letter agency
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> brb piss
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know, I have this like, fear that by signing up as a medical patient that if they recriminalized it then my name is on a list, and that I should have just went underground
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> .bef
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But it's still a felony to grow here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> what fuck?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> bang--
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> bef++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> prem sniped the duck

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hell yeah, first few track are amazing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ehhh there's still something in this bowl
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I like how soundcloud shows where in the song people are when they leave comments
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I'd rather hit some green
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> rest of the tape is certified dope naturally, but they're instant favorites
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats why i got this one hitter
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I just wish this mixtape was cut up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I like being able to throw on a track
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah a .cue would be nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I've meaning to just pack little ones in here but it's kinda hard
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> SagaciousKJB, I ALWAYS mean to pack smaller bowls and then I end up packing a full one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I will remember like three or four times in a row then forget again
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> It's a prollum
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yuup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude what I hate is right now having these jars full of big ass nugs, I keep like, forgetting that each little nug is like 4 fucking bowsl
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .r pockettape2 STYLUST BEATS - The Pocket Tape Pt. 2: https://soundcloud.com/stylustbeats/stylust-beats-the-pocket-tape-pt2
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thatsa problem i want to have
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah when I was typing it I was like "Why is this an issue again?"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's hard not to smoke a lot more I guess is what I'm saying
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> rdy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no doubt

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha ¤  Laz ¤  prem ¤  SagaciousKJB ¤  ready for a b? And it's  ¤  Laz's  ¤  Turn to start the countdown.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> These days I buy in larger amounts than I ever used to and I'm probably more wasteful than ever. Not that I literally waste weed, but I'm not trying to squeeze every blackened ball of pseudo-ash into a workable hit like I have been most of my smoking life
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I started with like 50 grams of this girl scout cookies on Dec 9th, and then I weighed like a few days ago and it's down to 28
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> right now weed is literally the only thing I buy for myself 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> just because I don't care to buy anything else
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> so I'm able to be more loose with it, so to speak
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah I have been trying to break the habit of burning a bowl until it's totally whitened ash
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> haha yeah I probably picked up some bad habits because I've been smoking alone for like 5 years now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I finally started throwing my resin away
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I haven't smoked a bowl with another human being except for one time
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm still not very good at cleaning out pipes. The last three or four I've owned were cheapo little pipes, like $15 glass ones from the store
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I just use them until they're fucking gross and throw them away and buy another one lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> usually lasts me quite awhile
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I can unclog them and whatnot but I never do a full deep clean
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I just America that shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> throw it in the trash like No Man's Sky and go get another one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> its not a bad plan at a certain point
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> shit can take a whil
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah for pipes I can see that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah man. I work hard and finally get paid well for it, so Ive decided to let some things go
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> being a thrifty stoner is one of them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I swear I just cleaned my bong the other day though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I saw the dude that use to be like a drummer for guns n roses on celebrity rehab
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> He was addicted to pot and I was like "psshh"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .g guns n roses celebrity rehab
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But then they showed his bong like totally covered in fucking resin and he's like "Oh man I just bought this last night, I need a new one" and he throws it against the wall
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Yeah I knew a girl named Hannah who went to rehab for weed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I was like what?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Just stop buying it, girl.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'll take your weed. You go home. You're fixed.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> She was fucking sexy, this lil redhead girl who LOVED to toke
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I guess her parents found out and flipped (this was when we were like 21-22)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> after that she never came around anymore
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> My D never got wet.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i cant say ive ever stopped for more than maybe 4 months
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Rehab prevented me from locking down some ginger pussy.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah, me neither. I don't really know how long.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * SagaciousKJB is trying to remember
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Even when I first moved to Austin and had no hook-up, I still knew a couple people that would smoke with me occasionally
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I'm starting to think only a few months too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah probably 3-4 months is the longest I've gone
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hold up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that drummer, Steven Adler, it says he was born Michael Coletti
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> How do you get from Michael Coletti to Steven fucking Adler.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Coletti is a dope ass name
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah Steven Alder is fucking stupid
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> No wonder he turned into a loser
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> dude you have been working on that paper since 'Nam
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha thats a fair point
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> cant say ive been to school for anything im interested in so it's a bit of a different situation
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Even if you're interested, school can be a chore man
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah, it's a different experience
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I actually like to write.  I mean, what I'm writing about right now kind of sucks but you know
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Been writing about nature for about 6 months and like, I am totally over it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> there are definitely some problems with the system
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I just think it's really funny because people call college the liberal indocrination chamber and so far....
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Speaking of which, I'm avoiding politics classes pretty much entirely lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> not a bad idea.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> both sides have gone full retard
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> These two girls today, one is somewhere in her 30s, the other is 16 and on the high school's advanced placement, got into an argument about Japan today...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THe fucking discussion was about ethics and some swats named Rolston and Rachel
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm like "Where the fuck did Japan even get into this?"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol Rolston
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Holmes Rolston III
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I can't help but imagine him in a leisure jacket with a monocle and pipe
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no fucking kidding
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That just seems like a weird thing for that name to have been so popular too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> theres punchable faces, then theres punchable names
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I mean, within their family
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Three times in a row
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> his family must hate him

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> y
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Most of the parts my classmates marked as being confusing I'm pretty sure are just confusing to them because they're stupid.  TO put it bluntly....
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im at 27:11 in the pocket tape 2. love this track
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no doubt sag
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the LSD remix on this mixtape is nutso
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it probably didnt help that i went to a school for dropkicks, but that was a pretty sad realisation i had on the first day of class
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> so good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hell yeah, thats the exact track i was talking about
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> :')
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I like looking at the comments. You can see the parts of the tape people just flip out on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> this is one of them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I need to listen to this tape at some point
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Can't pay attention to shit right now though

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha fuck yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Which is a oddly sexually suggestive name to me I don't know if that's ok
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ?syrupsplash
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> haven't played it since it first came out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Like...  I'm not sure why syrup and splash makes me think of sex
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah I haven't really played it since GTAO was brand new
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I might be repressing something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like the first two months of GTAO being out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> same
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh word, you playing it on ps4?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> when Voodoo and Daz and TEOS were playing a bunch
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> prem 31:50 this beat is fucking ridiculous man
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> sweet, ive been dying to play gta in first person
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Pharoahe
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> it's actually the next game im gonna get
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> All I want is RDR2
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> p sure that was Monch I heard rapping
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yessssssss Sag
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah i donno where the track list has gone for this
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Except I keep anticipating they will fuck up the shit with mulitplayer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i imagine the single player campaign will still be legendary
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> HOpe so
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> but yeah, i wouldnt expect the multiplayer to be anything less than gta online
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Literally the only game I will bother buying a new console or upgrading my pc to play
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't really care for gta online much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Just something about it is not appealing...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> omg whatever is happening at 34:45 is giving me goosebumps
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But some of the game modes are fun.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i got this new xbox for mass effect andromeda

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Is thuggstep like dubstep but gangsta?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> when the term was originally coined, yeah definitely
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that tape is more on some general hip hop influenced bass music rather than dubstep

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I was all alone haha

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that's 25000 hits of the script, doesn't count all the individual b's 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it would need to be GhostofCT + prem + Premium + Buddha + Laz + H5 + SagaciousKJB  + CaliGangstar  etc etc

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> let's just ballpark it at 60K total
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> !calc 60000 * 0.1
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Answer is ( 6000 )
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> !calc 6000/28
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Answer is ( 214.29 )
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> 214 pounds of weed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Prem stopped at 13337
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> not 25k
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> on his original acct
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> !bongs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wait 6000 grams would be 6 kilograms...  So like 12 pounds lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> pfff wish it gave like total room stats, top 10 bongers, etc
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> would be rad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Or maybe i can't math

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> nothing like a good hit after a HIT
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Do you use prolific.ac Buddha?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> it's a nice way to earn a little extra cash during downtime
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Usually quick academic surveys/studies for decent payout
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Paypal too none of that gift card shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah, those are cool
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I used to do a few in Houston because my friend's sister was a rep
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> once you got in her network she'd hit you up constantly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i wasn't always the demo, though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> aye, yeah I only get ones I fit the demo for but they weed it out for you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> she did a little bit but it wasn't perfect
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> she still emails me occasionally even though she says I've been taken off her list
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> so there must be multiple lists
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> haven't done one in like 6 years lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Ah this is all through the site and their prescreening questions
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> my phone has google rewards which gives me surveys occasionally. they're typically 2-4 questions and give you like, cents worth of google play credit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah I was doing those for a while too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> 11 cents
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> 19 cents
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * Laz throws 50 cent down a flight of stairs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> One of my favorite rap stories ever
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> in the past two years i've probably gotten like ten bucks worth of google play credit from it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i get way less surveys than i used to. idk why
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I think those are often based on location services
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> oh, no it says since 11/2015 i've earned $28.37 in rewards credit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that's p dope
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Not bad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I've probably made close to that in the last week or two on prolific
