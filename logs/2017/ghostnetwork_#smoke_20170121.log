[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Lots of very good drugs at their shit too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> do these motherfuckers even play bas music anymore?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I went to philly solo and stayed in a hotel for 3 days

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha thats ill

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> sounds like a good place to have fun for sure
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> all the big festivals around here have been pretty wack the past few years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive definitely gotta start looking into some hippy shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im already halfway looking like greek jesus over here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Oh you'll fit right in
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Dude I sold so much hash at the last festival
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I legit just walked around the camping area yelling "who wants some god damn hash"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> People would stop into our campsite and just try to sell us shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I bought some shrooms before we were even done setting our tents up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> lmao word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> And some K
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I came back K-rocked out of my mind while they were setting the tents up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive only been going to the bullshit inner city festivals, you dont get that kind of shit going on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> definitely happens out bush though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Eventually one guy was just like "laz just hold this pole. That's it. Hold the pole"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I helped!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> In my defense it was some really good ket
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> word, cant blame you there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We also tripped on some really good L and uh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Well have you heard of this silent disco concept
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> there are definitely some dope festivals for getting fucked up and fucking, but the music is straight up horrid
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We sat outside the gates of that and laughed our asses off for like an hour at people dancing to nothing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the fuck?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah you all wear headphones with lights on em and there's two DJs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Like you can see who's listening to 'red' or 'blue'
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's lame as fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh okay cool, i was gonna say, ive seen it with headphones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> So we sat outside laughing at the whole idea
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> but anything is possible at a fetival
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Then went back to my site and ate my entire camp's supply of veggies
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We had like four bags of carrots, celery, cucumbers once we figured out how a knife works
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Which uh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> You shouldn't give two dudes on acid a knife to begin with
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> figuring out how shit works can take what seems like hours
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Then Karl Denson's Tiny Universe played from like 3am to 7am
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Shit was wild
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I tried to play minecraft on acid once
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Just kinda sat in a pool for an hour
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Then we tried to play pool
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was so amazed at how beautiful the balls and table were
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> One game took like 4hrs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> The chalk marks on the table had some awesome patterns going on in my defense
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> but the colors on the balls!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Kid who was babysitting me was drunk and was just constantly like "alright dude let's finish this game already"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Got impatient after maybe 2 hours
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no fucking kidding yo. i wish i could see colours popping that vibrantly daily
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> gotta get some robot eyes and boost the saturation
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Oh yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Man I have acid stories for days now that I think about it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I spent a good two years tripping every weekend
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We tried to watch a hockey documentary and this old lady who was some guys mom was a lizard
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> And it kinda freaked me out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> So we switched to the brave little toaster which was awesome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> .bang
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i love wearing colored glasses now after this one trip. when the suns out i gotta have pink or blue
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the world looks fucking horrible without them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> If you haven't noticed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I don't see black or white
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Everything's just a shade of red.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I'm just a human.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha, im pretty sure thats not your first trip that ends with brave little toaster
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i always go back to certain shit for safety
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I dunno man I had a good time with skyrim
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I thought I did so much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was told the next day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I sat in a puddle and killed mudcrabs for like 5 hours
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> In my head I was all "I am the dragonborn bitch"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i love that shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> Fuck Jews
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Man I wish I could still take acid
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Lithium + LSD = seizures or death
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> So no thanks.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Not gonna even risk one tab.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeaaaa thats probably a good plan
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yo H5 what up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> kebab'n kikes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> MAGA
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> one time i watched batman begins while tripping on shrooms. i remember another hour or so of footage that was never in the movie
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ahahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> lol my nigga
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Man I need to go off meds just so I can trip one more time and watch rick and morty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I'd just end up watching the plumbus bit over and over
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> get some level 5 shroomery going on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I wish rick and morty was out when I was still able to trip
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I missed out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> So prem I was looking at my two white whale records last night.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> An original press of Can's Tago Mago goes for like $300

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> basically, in a lane near where i was going to school, the council put up a plaque that said something like "in this spot once stood a piece by famous artist banksy. graffiti vandals destroyed it on such and such date"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i nearly died from laugh crying too hard

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> People get pissed when they come out and like
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I'll catch them leaving 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> "anything biting?" "nothing but a ton of fucking sea robins"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they look pretty cool
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah they do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But they're not really desirable
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no doubt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol you can even see the prawn we used to catch it in its mouth
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Especially undesirable when we've got like fluke, sea bass and sand sharks around here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I wanna go down south and catch a real shark though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i dont actually like fish. im only down with sharks and crustaceans
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> You need some legit gear though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qI7Q8wLMi_k/maxresdefault.jpg
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> This dude caught a fucking hammerhead
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Like come on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> That looks like a challenge
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> And fun as fuck
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i remember shitty myself one day when my uncle caught a small gummy shark out on the speedboat
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> shitting*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Ah yeah the ones we catch up north here are technically dogfish
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Little fuckers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> god damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im torn cause i like sharks but they're so tasty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> That was from this video
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qI7Q8wLMi_k
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> kinda like cows
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> They legit have to kayak some bait out like a mile
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> they're total bros but hamburgers yo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> you need like a harness and pliers and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> no doubt, thats pretty next level
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> when i see shit like this though, i always hope the dudes get eaten
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> that massive bull red he caught
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> not a fan of sports fishing, especially for sharks
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Ah I usually catch and release
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Unless it's either certain species or if I'm that hungry
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah that thing is a monster
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha prem 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i mean, if you're catching garbage ass fish, thats legit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> theres definitely a right way to do it too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> some of these motherfuckers are plain violent
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> not in this vid specifically
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> b?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha ¤  prem ¤  Wanna spark one up?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah I mean I usually eat sunfish if I'm that hungry and I'm out all day hiking/fishing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I carry a small coffee can with me to cook em on and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Freshwater bass always get thrown back
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> If a saltwater bass is large enough to legally keep it gets eaten
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We always follow legal limits in the boat though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> My dad almost got a fine for having a fish that measured legal on one side, but when you flipped it was a half inch under legal limit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> They take that shit seriously
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> for real
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> And you're only allowed I think four per fisherman
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> as they should, the ocean is straight up fucked
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Some dudes got a hefty fine for catching like 20 in a day 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> we got a massive problem with fake "flake" which is meant to be battered gummy shark
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> but they'll kill any old shark now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> http://www.wfsb.com/story/31600295/4-fishermen-arrested-for-illegally-fishingstriped-bass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> fucking cunts
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> That was here last year
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> All of those are WAY too small to keep
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Legal limit is over 2ft long
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats the best use of police money ive seen in years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Right?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> nah the best use of police money is not bothering us having fires and painting under the highway
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha true that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that was some p uplifting news
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> oh shit prem
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was looking for firewood last night at the spot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> now if they could just do that at the docks, that'd eb nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I come across a roller with a pad on it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> perfectly good fucking roller
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> commercial shit is beyond fucked up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Just took the old pad off and took it home with me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> The DEP here is really good about going to the docks to check for fishing licenses/limits
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Shit, they've boarded our boat several times.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha fuck yeah, i love how wasteful people are
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Dude was probably like fuck it, I don't wanna get paint all over my hands
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> oh, okay
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> More for me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I'm so un-wasteful I use my empty 40oz bottles to hold paint lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> You can fit more of those in your bag than you can a gallon bucket
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats legit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> 3 40s, a roller and a tray in your bag, that's all you need
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> 3 colt 45's, two rustos, baby that's all we need

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> oh haha that might be why I broke the lastfm script
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'll have to check
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> No, if you don't have tabs in the right place, or have your editor inserting 5 spaces instead of the actual tab, your program won't work

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I mean, can't it?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have been thinking about smart home shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Isn't the Fitbit app made with Java?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm p sure java could talk with arduino
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So like, mak a raspberry pi with a motor servo attached, hook it to the wall, and then you can log in and use it to open or close your drapes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> SOmething like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> maybe not Java SE but I bet EE or some extension could do it

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's frustrating when people that can barely read tell you a piece of your writing is hard to understand
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's like, what do you do with that information...  You can't be rude and be like "Hard for you" lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But do you dumb it down?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Maybe there are effective ways of saying the same thing with more common vernacular, in places.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that's what I'm thinking
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Seems like a vocabulary barrier in a lot of places
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * SagaciousKJB needs to stop being a walking dictionary
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I mean, at the same time, some of the people are literally fresh out of high school and when I listen to them read the class material allowed, it's obvious they are not really strong readers.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> everyone needs an editor
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I don't know what to do when a person like that says they don't understand like, is it me, or them

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i just don't really care that much lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You're so cool

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> mine would be a lot fucking higher than 3400
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> we spent so much time not being here

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> and i still smoke a lot without oping
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I smoke pretty much all day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> it would be interesting to know though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> what would be interesting but way more depressing is how much money i've spent on weed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude just think about how much you spent on weed 10 years ago versus now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I use to spend almost $100 on a quarter
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> 10 years yeah.. but like 12-13 it was way lower
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> back when everyone put 5 on it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> the good ol days
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao Never had that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> We did the everyone got the next one system and people would always end up getting the bag more than the others
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> it wasn't always literally 5
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> some dudes definitely got suckered into paying a lot more
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> some people had 5 on it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its just that a couple others had like 15
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> we used to ditch and go to my friend's house near the school to smoke. it was nice and convenient and a lot of people knew it was a chill spot. so there was always the occasional rich kid or something who would show up with like an oz and blow our minds lol

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> my friend's house was cool because his mom didn't get home til like 6 or sometimes later. we'd play dave mirra bmx and smoke all day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I just ended up not liking to smoke with lots of people
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They were alwasy dumbasses and that's how they got caught

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> we watched all kinds of shit. our favorite thing was to flip channels and craft bits about shit on tv
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> dave mirra bmx was the shit man
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i miss that game
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hell yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> rip dave :(
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> one of the best sports games ever imo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> cte man
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> dave mirra bmx++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> bmx and skating games are sorely missing from this gen of consoles
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That Will Smith movie that came out about that is pretty good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The CTE stuff I mean
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i haven't seen it yet but i heard that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i remember jada making a big deal that he wasn't nominated for an oscar for it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I feel like the supporting character roles were better than Smith's performance 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But like, really good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Concussion?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> is that what its called
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .imdb concussion
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I thought that was it but thought that was too simple lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The actor that played Mike Webster in it stole the show I think
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Whelp it didn't take long for protester-and-police clashes today
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .bang

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> death and life
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Two types of people in this world
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> People that owned the NES light gun and people that didn't
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> <===
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I wish I still had mine.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I still have the NES but nfi what happened to the gun.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I was a fool growing up and time and again would sell a console I was done with to help get something else
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> My SNES doesn't work anymore I don't think :(
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I tried it recently and it wouldn't power on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The SNES was my favorite console growing up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Worked fine a year or two ago last time I tried.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Mine was Genesis
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The N64, PS1 and PS2 were equally fantastic but the SNES is my pinnacle
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> http://bash.org/?105252
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> He's got a point.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> wow I haven't been to bash in fucking ages

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> what happened?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .np
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Guy from the barber shop next to the liquor store stops in for a bottle of water as I'm buying a handle
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Asks how long it'd last me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I answered honestly and he just kinda sounded like he felt sorry
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> fuck yeah it works again
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> SagaciousKJB, you telling me about the spaces shit made a light go on in my head
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> SagaciousKJB++

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> SagaciousKJB++
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <H5> don't fuck with my nigga
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Iunno my point with the whole thing from the store
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's not cool to condescend someone for their problems
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's like telling a homeless guy to "just stop being lazy and get a job"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> b?

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Have you listened to this album, Laz?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Not a big fan of them tbh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Was a decent album for sure but everyone running around screaming AOTY kinda killed it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ahh, yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I mean my pick for AOTY was highly unconventional though so
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I think Dan Friel's Life was the best of that year
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> actually let me fire up an oldie
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .np
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> guess I've never listened on spotify
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> .yt dan friel life
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> All analog electro-noise type stuff. really goof
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> good

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] * Laz clicks

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Am I gonna be the one to point out the racism in a rap group named Spooks
