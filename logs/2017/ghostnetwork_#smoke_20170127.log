[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wow I wouldn't want to go to Burma
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Not unless I was driving a tank
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that one they bought trucks and had to build a bridge over the river cock
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Were they driving on like, those crazy ass world's most dangerous roads?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the patagonia one they upset the locals and they rioted on them which was interesting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I always want to see those ice road truckers piss off the locals in the himalayas
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> there is a bolivia one where they are on that really fucked up one on the side of a mountain 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol The one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You know it's a fucked up road when it's like "the road" lol

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah everybody has seen it on the wild life shows or something lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that one is like, infamous
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah hawaii has some crazy shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the shit that clarkson does on there is just insane
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> He must love his job lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> he's trying to go around a car and the ground is just crumbling under his wheel
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> he must make bank
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well he was rich as fuck before top gear even 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> he's been on the show since like the 80's
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think it would be funny if they test drove a tesla
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but his parents created the paddington bear doll
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> is that the one that had the cortoroy jeans?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wow I don't know if that's how you spell that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Cortiroy?

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they might have had pants
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I never had one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I had some weird ass bear with corduroy pants
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I googled it....  
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah I had no idea how to spell it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> If I ever do ectasy I want to go buy a pair of those and just rub my legs all night
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> !spell corduroy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> The word "corduroy" is spelled correctly.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> oh hey that still works
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Oh aparently the bear I'm thinking of was literally named Corduroy lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> hmm never saw that one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> my mom probably has one she collects bears and dolls
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Does she have beanie babies lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> a few
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man I remember people had so many of those things
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> mostly hers are ones that happen to fit in a tree nicely
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Does she put them in a tree?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Because that would seem weird otherwise lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> like she has this tree in the corner and she decorates it for the holidays and like for valentines day it's full of little bears with hearts on them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Okay that's what I figured
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah still weird though /shrug
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Decorations like that are fun though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I like minatures
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> LIttle towns and shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah I collect some stuff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> oh yeah I have a lemax collection
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh I don't collect any but I want to lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well mine is halloween based
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have a collection of bottles on my shelves
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But mostly because I didn't know what else to put on them for decoration
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> with me I always dug train sets and the little towns people would make
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that's what I meant by miniatures
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know if there's something else called miniatures lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> but yeah building the little towns are more fun than the train sets
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know if you have ever watched American Dad but there's a funny episode about that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah people just call it minatures
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> He builds a miniature town and then decides to shrink himself down small enough to live there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah saw that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lots of guys build little towns like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> sometimes war scenes or other sets
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I love that scene where like, Haily jumps into the bud that he thought was a topiary haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I watched that ep but barely remember it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> She was like "These bushes look really familiar" and he says, "Yeah, they're these peculiar little topiaries I found in an altoids tin under the water heater."
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They don't put enough scenes from american dad on youtube
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> With family guy you can pretty much type in any random moment and find a clip lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man that last episode of oak island was a snore fest
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> fuck yeah it was
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I got the wrong one entirely at first
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Was one from like last season or some shit when they finally even got digging equipment
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> half was like watching a bathtub fill and the rest was basicaly watching people in a library
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I was hoping the researcher guy would at least be interesting but I don't even remember what he was talking about
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> FDR or some shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha GhostofCT SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah nothing went anywhere
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm having a brain fart
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Is FDR a different guy than Teddy Roosevelt?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> some old niggers toe and a pic of fdr we've seen a hundred times
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Because I thought FDR stood for Franklin Delawhatever Roosevelt, but there was two Roosevelts??
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah it's a great nephew I think to teddy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wait so
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wow that changes so much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Teddy is a badass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah teddy was at the turn of the century and fdr was like 30+ years later
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> indeed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah see I thought they were saying he was on Oak Island
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> shows how much I was paying attention lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> fdr was kind of a spoiled child growing up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I feel like they're getting dangerously close to jumping the shark with that curse crap
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> their producers must be old reality show producers for big brother or someshit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I thought it was funny last season that Fred Noland guy dies, and they're like, "Oh the 7th man has died," and now the "legend" is "7 must die while ins earch of the treasure" lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah dude totally
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's almost like watching two different shows
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> naw that was this season
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The narrator is just like, "I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yup
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> this whole marie antionette thing is really grabbing at straws here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wow I didn't know they tied that into it somehow
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah that was the fdr stuff mentioned in one of his letters
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I feel like they were just like "Well we might as well hear every crack pot theory"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> back then they didn't know what they do now so they were just guessing what might be down there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm gonna have to rewatch and see what they actually said
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THey thought they knew what was down there thought?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah and there is a lot of those theroies
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well they all seem to have different ideas
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah a lot of conflict
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> a few think it was the templars and some thing it's pirate treasure 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I've noticed shakespeare has come up a couple times
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> then there is the whole shakespere thing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> that one is really out there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The one about francis st. clair or whatever almost seemed feasible
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> why would bacon go through that much effort to hide it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh wait, bacon
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's who I meant
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I still say it's the templars because of the indians
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Wait who was the guy that was basically like the old day Elon Musk?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The Migmau?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah st claire was the templar leader
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The spanish connection also makes a shit ton more sense if it is templar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the old elon musk dude is bacon
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I thought that one seemed kind of plausible
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> well, not plausible but I mean, feasible, it could be done and made some sense
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But the shakespeare thing....
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude no one gave enough of a fuck about shakespeare to do that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah total garbage
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Shakespeare is like the ultimate example of people getting way more popular when they're dead lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> plus why bury paper that is degradeable underground
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Right and booby trap it with flood tunnels
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Of your tunnels in minecraft Buddha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> someone should make oak island in minecraft lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think I have said this before but still
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> the templars had the know how
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that's kind of an important thing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Like, they totally needed some engineering expertise
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> plus after they fled france they went to ireland then they say they went to norway and stayed there for a while
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> now the thing about norway is it's viking land
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> we now know about 200 years before the templars vanished the vikings did have a settlement in canada
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah and I know there's alot of evidence of them landing in nova scotia
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah I think they borrowed a road map from the vikings lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> plus I don't know if you have ever watched america unearthed but those stones that are on there have the same templar codes on them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I feel like there's a lot of shit that was going on in those times that we don't really know about
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> No I've never seen that one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah lots of holes everywhere
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> oh you gotta watch that one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Sounds interesting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> why they haven't had that dude on oak island I have no idea
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> brb munchies
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah I've got some chocolate covered pretzels and colby pepperjack cheese bites

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> This big burly guy comes out of his house telling him he's gonna fuck him up and all this shit, so the kid literally throws the fucking skateboard right into the guy's mouth and runs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Was awesome

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> trucks will fuck you up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> thats solid metal

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> why
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean technically the laws justify it but I've never heard of someone not arrested for stabbing someone and a lot of the times it sounded like self-defense
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You've pretty much got to be getting the ever loving shit kicked out of you lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Texas will side with self defebse
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah Texas is pretty different
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I think it's because of all the gang stuff here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> check this story
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> http://abcnews.go.com/US/charges-texas-father-beat-death-daughters-molester/story?id=16612071
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that was nearish here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I heard something similar
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But the guy straight up beat the guy to death after the fact
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Raped his son or something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> He didn't get off but they only charged him with manslaughter or something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I wonder if the guy like totally meleed on his face or if he just got in a few good hits

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> From hawk: Right. Thats not a strategy for Best Trick. To only try a trick youve never made. The strategy is to try something youre sure you can make, and then go from there.
