[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I like ufc but I don't really watch it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> what's happening?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well remember I mentioned that my camera got jacked?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> oh yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I remembered that there was an assault here and the cops came and I realized that it was probably the dude that got arrested
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I do now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So yeah I just went to go tell the guy that was assaulted about it because I figure that's probably pretty pertinent to his case
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Was hoping maybe he recognized them 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> At the very least maybe he can hand it to the cop and it will end up like, "Oh yeah, these are his asshole friends" *shrugs*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I haven't talked to a cop in a really long time, not counting my step brother
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> he's a cop with Austin PD
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't really remember last time I did
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't like to make a habit of it lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean my buddy and I talked to a bicycle cop outside of a donut shop
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That was different though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Anyway, yeah I watched a few UFC fights and was just like, not really that entertained by them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THe ground and pount is just not real exciting to me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> How long ago was it?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Shit, 2000ish
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Tank Abbot was still fighting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The sport has evolved quite a bit in the last decade. 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The fighters are way more of strikers and actual fighters, not so much grapplers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> There's still some of that, to be sure, but way less than 10 or 15 years ago
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ahh I see
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have been wondering how it got more popular
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the sport has evolved into a bunch of strikers and a few guys who are really good on the ground
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Becuase it didn't seem like a sport for those without attention spans lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Most fights spend the majority on their feet nowadays
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The old UFC was a lot more judo and jiujitsu
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Now that's more of a tool in the larger toolbox of disciplines
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h7KazyvRZI

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> :)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah and I don't know how much of it to really believe, but he claims he use to do some "private security" shit down in Nicuragua and Venezula
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I mean I wouldn't have believed him about him making that dude tap in 19 seconds if it weren't for the youtube video lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I have a friend who occasionally works private security
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> he used to be a professional thief
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like armed robber of drug dealers, paid by other drug dealers
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that's about what this guy seemed to be doing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> he did 9 years in the pen
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But like, I don't really ask people a lot of details
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ah, my friend has told me all about it. we're good buddies
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> he's pretty open about his past
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Mafia movies have taught me that not knowing shit is way better than knowing shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Of gear even knowing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it was like 20 years ago
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I'm not sure when he was active, probably 10-15 years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But yeah basically he use to rob drug dealers of drugs too, but like, it was more of a para-military thing there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> "law enforcement"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> my friend got chased by a helicopter and everything
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> had a change of clothes stashed that he actually used halfway through
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like next to some house down the street
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> This guy never detailed much of anything, except some talk about pulling a guy's fingernails off but that sounded like bullshit to me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> oh shit haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah pretty much the guy wouldn't tell them where the drugs were
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> My cat is so insistent on sitting on my lap that I'm just resting the keyboard on top of him as I type
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that's awesome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i like cats that don't give af what you do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Yeah

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's funny how some cats won't move off you even if you like stand up though

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I've had a lot of cats over the years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> had a few dogs and I do like dogs, but a cat is more my speed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I've had these three for 7 years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> dogs are too needy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah never cared much for dogs either

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And I love her because she's like, I don't know, tom-boyish, kind of crude, so she just sits around like, with no bra and her hands behind her head like nipping out of her sweater
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's a beautiful thing lol

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah screw that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Although...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have this friend that had a reduction
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> And they're like, fucking amazing now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Like they shaped them all perky I don't know how
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Then you know, since it was a reduction, there's no fake shit in there.  Then on top of that, she has her ordinarily huge DDD sized nipples on C sized boobs now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I mean...  Gotta say I'm a fan lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> good nipples can make a big difference
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Hers were like novelty size lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Literally as big around as my thumb
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Pretty sure I could give her nips a blowjob
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha thats weird
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah... But lately I've been wanting to hit her up lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha eggbot SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Got it home, took like, passed out on my phone

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't know
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I think he's been hanging out with Laz too much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol That could be it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man pizza hut is fucking stupid
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THey try to appeal with carry out deals...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .idmb black sails
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Literally the only reason to get pizza hut is beause cheaper places don't deliver
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .imdb black sails
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'd rather go to little casesars
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> god I would get sick of Pizza Hut dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I like going to Little Caesars and asking them to make me a fresh batch of crazy bread
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Actually I wonder if they deliver here...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't get the crazy bread that's been laying around
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like some fucking third world country
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah it pisses me off when pizza hut gives me shit that I can tell is stale
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> sometimes I get things from Pizza Hut and it's like, did you even fucking LOOK at my pizza before you boxed it up?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> clearly sloppily made
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> that's another reason I hesitate ordering from them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I like a couple of their items
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> THey have this big dinner box where they put pizza, breadsticks in wings in one big box
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But once the buffalo sauce got spilled on my pizza
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but overall they're probably my least favorite of the big chains
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Turned out really good so now I get that normally lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah it's pretty much their wings and the white sauce they use
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's only reason I like them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> their wings are decent. I like the dry rubs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> papa johns is my least favorite place though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the cajun one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and the ranch one
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I really love their buffalo sauce so
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Plus ours for some reason actually use a WingStreet for their wings
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> NOt sure if they all do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> oh man, wingstreet
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> People have been asking for years if they'd sell their sauces a la carte and they never budge.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> And they'd be accusing of him riding all over again anyway
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's weird dude sometimes I"ll order wings online, then fill in my address information, and the order will suddenly change
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Though I've heard occasionally a store manager will sell a bulk amount to you if you ask
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Damn
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well my buddy has a few bottles of their shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> LIke the spicy garlic
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I don't know where he got them

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> GhostofCT is there any possible scenario where you'd consider removing all that ascii garbage from the Spark it Up line so I can try to find the b total in there ?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Thre are like three characters that are coming through for some reason that aren't in any other lines of code
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its those fuckin weird ass symbols
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Lol my friends know me too well
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Buddha, can't you regex the numbers?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Dudes talking about how much this ski resort sucks, then goes [11:33:32] <beep> Oh, but the bloodys here are made with taaka
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I can't regex the fucking weird ascii characters
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> NOBODY puts those in their scripts because they fuck things up and Rotten put them in like 15 years ago and nobody has taken them out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I just wish they were hyphens or something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> even better there should be NO symbols and it should just bold the names
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah but I mean, I'm pretty sure that [:ascii:] in regex would match those, so you could form some kind of expression to pull the numbers out between
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Or better yet, just scrub everything that's not alphanumeric
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't know what you're talking about

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ^ that thing is my nightmare
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .s
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> Buddha you have been bitching constantly about everything. My coding, the url, and you don't seem happy with what you have and you are the only one. You don't like my coding but you are more than happy to use the stats I have gathered over the years when yours has very seldomly been present
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I only asked you to fix the stats script when you bragged that you spend so much time working on stuff for GTANet, which is cool and I had no idea you were doing that.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm not bitching dude. I'm your friend. We've known each other for YEARS.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I come here happily AND I got a bunch of folks to come back when we realized everyone was still alive, just scattered.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Also I pointed bluntcave.com here and eggburt pointed sysnode.org here, but you don't seem to care
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> we all want the same things
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I don't run this for me, I never have I've run it for you guys
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> But you're so hostile to us when we ask for things like hey dude, can I see the bong stats?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> you tell me to fuck off
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> instead of just sharing with me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> why?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I would share any script with you if you asked, in a heartbeat
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> you guys were idle for months at a time it was a waste so I shut it down it's back up just because you all were interested in it again
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Casey I had no idea how to get here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> You wanted us to remember your IP
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> sorry, but I didn't write it down
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> We're here NOW and isn't that clear evidence that we all WANTED to be here all along? lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I would too but you have spent so much time talking shit and then want to use parts of it is bullshit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I didn't talk shit, man. I said one day that we have some broken scripts so you should use your expertise to fix them since you mentioned that you do a lot for gtanet
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and you took that really personally, when I Didn't mean it that way at all
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I apologize. Fuck.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's been quite a bit more than one day infact almost everyday
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> What do you want me to do? Leave?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm sort of at a loss here
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I explained myself, I apologized
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> if I wanted you to leave I could arrange that myself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> sigh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> is this a Trump thing?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> is it because of my Facebook posts?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol no is it to you is the real question
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> not whatsoever
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> you've seen the people I'm friends with on there. if politics were a requirement I'd have no friends
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Frankly, I asked why you don't want to fix Ghostbot things when you openly shared with us that you work on gtanet stuff. So why is Ghostbot off limits?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> you never even addressed that you just got mad at me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> what is broken?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> None of the stats have counted for years?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> !help
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> for help with commands please visit http://www.up.r0tt.com/3/G)-(OSTofCT/gbot%20help.htm
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ^
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> just random things. Nothing impactful. It was an innocent question, honestly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it's become this HUGE thing now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> so? it's just an outdated script
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> exactly, so I started making a new one and you got really upset
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> to you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> no, you've told me twice not to "steal" from you
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> If this network is for all of us and not just for you, then please just embrace that we all want it to be good. Put the other domains in the channel topic next to your IP, help me figure out how to read the damn Spark It Up line so I can count bongs for Mary, or whatever. I mean honestly none of it is going to hurt anything, just make this channel even more fun for all of us
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well if your scripting is so superior why wasn't mary here over the years recording her own?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I never said it was superior.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> tbh I'm just trying to learn python
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I can see why it would be bothersome for us all to just idle for months until you shut it down, and then come back, seemingly just suddenly giving a fuck again, and then on TOP of that to have criticisms of the somewhat defunct state of things...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yes, I can see that. and I apologized for knocking the broken scripts.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I don't think that's what Buddha's trying to say.  He's just bored and wants to code and make contributions here with that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but I had no idea it would be anything sensitive or offensive
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but if you want to say fuck me then fine I can just fuck right off

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> When?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> What do you want me to make?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> remember the auto away timer to deop people?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well better late than never? I mean, another way to look at it is that he's now got this time on his hands to learn new codes, and the first places he wants to use them for is here...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Casey, you're starting to wander now. You know I've moved like ten times and lived in multiple different cities. You've lived in the same house. That's why I don't have a bot running 24/7 for a decade
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> It's not because I don't care
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Do you want that to come back? The auto deop?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> That was on the ollllllld Mary which I lost
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> This Mary is 100% brand new
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't have any cool old stuff anymore. I have to start from scratch
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> right Ghostbot is 100% old and has been handling shit by himself for years as I always have
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't understand what you want
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> everyone knows this is your network
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I haven't had the luxury of being able to start from scratch he's had work to do
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nobody is trying to take your mantle, dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I WISH i didn't have to start from scratch? I would fucking kill to have my old scripts
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I lost hundreds of hours of work
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I don't care is somebody steals this hell I stole it from like 4 people now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> then what is the problem????????
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> please outline it form e
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I have no interest in taking this network for you or rendering Ghostbot obsolete. Nobody is making Ghostbot v2017
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggburt> ^ literally as soon as we heard ghostnet was up I shut down the new sysnode server and pointed irc.* here

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> So now you're not mad, and I'm the one who needs to relax?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah Casey, we ALL want to be here.

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I feel like all the critcism about Ghostbot is a bit undue
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> The only thing I mentioned was the stats script. His away and smoke scripts work fine
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I also think it's not really like, intended to be critical of Casey, the person behind it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggburt> gotta be honest I just read it as "these unicode characters are a pain in the arse"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> A pain in the navy and his shitty respect for that name to have land off
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> they really are, eggburt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I can't get the outta the damn string
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> get them*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's like if this is our home...  We all fucked off on our travels, and Casey had to shutter it up, and the cobwebs collected.  Now we're back, and I think we could all agree, a fresh coat of paint would be nice?

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's really fucking cool you kept Ghostbot alive, and all his data tables intact.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ty sag
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Actually it makes me think of like Data on startrek and keeping his circuitry alive lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't know why everyone left, but I do know that once we all knew the server was back up and how to get here, nobody wasted any time getting back online
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> what Buddha doesn't understand all those rough points he's had in his life growing up and what not I've had for years and still kept this place up and going best I can
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and egg and I immediately hooked up more domains to it, which I guess we're the only ones who use lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's not perfect but it's there
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm not diminishing that, Casey, but you asked why I don't have a bot running here the whole time
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and you know the answer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't think it's a small feat to keep a server or a bot going for 10 years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> All my code is dead on a corrupted harddrive
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well where we we be now if I didn't put forth the effort
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I know how Buddha feels having to start from scratch too...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I lost all my porn in the Great Hard Drive Crash Of 2011, I know those feels
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well look, I know the house analogy is corny but it fits.  You didn't bulldoze the place down, you kept it up for us to come back to.

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I've lost so many hard drives in the last decade and a half I could fill a graveyard

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> (Never seen the show)
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but yeah the scene with the lasers in the last episdoe
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> is one of the best scenes of the whole show IMO
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Friends is a good show
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> of Friends? or Breaking Bad?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't remember lasers in BB
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I prefer Seinfeld
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> In the final episode when he goes to Elliott and his wife's house, you know those rich people he used to do scientific stuff with
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and he tells them to keep his money
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> for Walter Jr
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> he uses Badger to point a laser through their back window and onto their chests while Walt tells them he has hitmen watching them
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it's fucking amazing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ohhh yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Damn I need to rewatch breaking bad

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I'm not really a huge fan of it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> LIke, compared to Breaking Bad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But it's a good show in its own right
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The only thing that really  stays that similar between the two shows is the directing style
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> There are a couple of like, chracter cross overs but nothing that ever is significant
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Unless I've just missed it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> no just some light crossover. its meant to be its own show and not a BB prequel
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah, does that pretty well
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like Tuco is in it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but briefly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I guess it's kind of like the story of how Saul became the shitbag lawyer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude I saw Tuco in a Star Trek episode the other day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Didn't realize he'd been acting that long
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> what ever happened to lenny?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I can't remember who lenny is lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lenny?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> saul's brother but I forgot his real name
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ohhh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> saul's brother is lenny from laverne and shirley
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well, where did you leave off? Spoiler arlerts lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I thought I watched all of season 1...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't remember how it ended in season 1 though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> me either
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> He bumped his head?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> maybe
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lolol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> What a memorable show
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I remember he got out of the house a little than he fucked saul
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> then*
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That's still pretty early on, they pretty much draw that and his revenge out until the end of season 2
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> ah ok
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't think I've seen season 3 actually
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Meh, I'm honestly not that into it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Breaking Bad had boring moments but they were like, well rewarded with awesome action seens and shit like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well not really action, but...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I don't know, the best shit that ever happens in Better Caul Saul is some craffty copyediting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> mostly just fan service
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They could just get Skylar over here to service this fan
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I fucking hated Skyler
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> now that little heroine chick jesse was banging...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Ohhhhh Yeah I forgot about her
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> heh KRysten Ritter
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> did you watch Jessica Jones?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I thought Skylar was pretty hot despite being a total bitch
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't find her hot. She has nice tits tho
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lmao That's what I was thinking about
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> meh marie would be better
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Marie was kinda sexy I thought
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> not her character but the actress
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> you like purple? have a purple mushroom bitch!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like in a next door neighbor's wife kinda way
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I mean, she's got the kind of face I'd like to see my dick in
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> BB isn't a show with attractive characters
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> which I like, tbh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Most of my favorite shows are ones that aren't full of fakely pretty people
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah I don't really care for the super model look
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> BB, The Sopranos, The Wire
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The Wire had some hot bitches though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> not to say I don't really like Mad Men or Game of Thrones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Its not a show with attractive architecture either
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> https://robzappulla.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/breaking-bad-finale-walt-skyler-house.jpg
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well...  Extras

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lolol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's always bothered me
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I think about this more than I like to admit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well you can blame their shitty ass New Mexico architexture
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Stucco all the things
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> All the things must be stucco
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> With those fucking taco shell tin roofs
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha GhostofCT Laz SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> truth
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> mm pizza

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Word, they're good pizza holders
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Nah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I was told hey had to ask people specifically not to throw pizzas on the roof
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> You know Bryan Cranston went up ther eand ate it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> that's pizza abuse
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol THat's fucked

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they had to have rebuilt that house on some set for the last season
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah wasn't it like burnt?

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I never understood how Michael Douglas was such a fuckin poonplunger 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> He's been in so many movies having film sex with like Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, all the 90s babes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's a mystery 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> married to Zeta Jones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> just constantly surrounded by amazing women
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Man...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I would go down on Catherine Zeta Jones if it gave me radiation poisoning
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Entrapment is worth watching only for the laser scene.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I'm talking about like, from behind, Entrapment style

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> well I went for other shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ahhh yes, I see you know your cobbler well
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they have rotisserie chickens for $4.99 you can't even buy a raw one at other stores for under $7
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> plus they are good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> http://www.tmz.com/2017/01/26/mischa-barton-hospital-mental-evaluation-possible-overdose/
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lolwut
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> oh yeah those whole rotisserie chickens are the shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> their whole deli section is pretty good
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Costco has a legit rotisserie chicken that's only like five bucks.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I read that they actually take a loss on them but they've been popular for so long that they keep selling them at 5 bucks
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> because it keeps people coming back
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> looks like she has cramps in those pics
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and once you go to Costco you don't buy just a rotisserie chicken
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah ahha she looks like she's possessed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> we don't have a costco
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol GhostofCT https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/cz8l9/girlfriend_leveling_need_advice/c0wdh6p/

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I've totally been bitched out for leaving bed early to get some grinding in

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> you can dual her with your epic purple headed staff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> my mage carried his for like up to level 80 and everyone was asking why I had a level 60 weapon so I'd just reply my purple headed staff is epic
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> meh this cobbler is aiight
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> not great but meh
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> even a bad cobbler is prolly still p tasty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> nope a friends wife made one once and put too much salt in it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ewww
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nasty
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Aye
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> My mother in law makes cookies that she puts just a teeeeeny bit more salt in than a normal recipe, and theyre fucking delicious that way
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but could easily be trash 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> if messed up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah tis a thin line
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but she's been making the same cookies since 'Nam so I don't think she could fuck it up
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> There's a fine line between a pinch and a punch of salt
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> she also bakes them for longer but on a lower temp
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> idk why
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> wonder if sea salt works
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> might be to keep them from drying out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> mayo instead of eggs works good for that too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> ive had chocolate cake with mayo
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah the oil helps a lot
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like a devils food
