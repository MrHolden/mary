[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> jesus christ. im getting real sick of this shit. just read "TIL that, according to George Lucas, the entire Star Wars saga is told by R2D2, some hundred years after Return of the Jedi."
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> okay, cool, thats exactly something that retard would say
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> thats extremely close to the actual articles headline
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> check out the article, its a sponsored post for some shitty book. "book states having learned this salivating fact from Lucas’s animation director Rob Coleman"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> aaand exactly one person in the comments read the article
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think im done.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> this new Hitman game is exactly what I fucking needed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> a u t i s m
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Buddha that game is fucking awesome
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I wish I had a xbone to play it on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> already got silent assassin on this level so that means now I can fuckin chop up the kitchen crew with the fire axe and not give a fuck about the collateral damage
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> disguise as a chef? don't mind if i do!
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> he fucking chops with the axe like PAtrick Bateman
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> A chef with a barcode neck tat
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its so awesome. 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> hahaha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> one of my favorite things is to kill people with random objects
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> did they put it out as a physical copy?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> also, to try and get through as much of a level as possible without changing out of my hitman suit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nah I bought digital cuz that's how I do now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I went full autismo this summer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I rarely ever buy a disc
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> got 100% on absolution
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Working on blood money now
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Blood Money is by far the best hitman game
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> tru
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah and this is basically Blood Money 2
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah I played like two levels
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i was starting to go digital but games are sitting at 40gb + updates
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It was rad
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I gotta say though my favorite stealth game ever
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Chaos Theory.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> microsofts servers are way too shitty to handle that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> especially since they dont give a single fuck about australia
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Are especially easy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think the only stealth game ive ever enjoyed was dishonoured
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the new hitman does look fun as fuck though
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was not a fan of Dishonored
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's just a totally different style than Hitman or Splinter Cell
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh yeah, for sure
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im a fan of the gameplay mechanics
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was rec'd it because of that which is the only reason I didn't like it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I beat Dishonored 2 but I wasn't in love with it.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Hitman, though. That's my love.
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the story and world were pretty horrible
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> "Oh you love Splinter Cell, try Dishonored"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Ummm
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah, in contrast with what i just said, the most disappointing purchase ive ever made was dishonoured 2

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that does seem a littl menacing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Supposed to be an Orca?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> i suppose
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> SagaciousKJB http://db.fursuit.me/?c=viewsuit&id=4401
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> His whole bedroom is filled with whales
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's...terrifying
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I got really high on benzos the other night and looked for funny fursuits
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> And...came across that instead
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Suuure, you ain't gotta lie bro, get your nut to some porpoise costumes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> nah dude
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> ferrets only
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I also found out some furries find fursuits scary?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Like how do you even
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Weird
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's like a straight dude that thinks a woman's body is disgusting
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean I guess some chicks like being choked and stuff
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> SO maybe it's like that kind of thing
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But like the fursuit is your whole fetish, no?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah but maybe it's like a sado-masochism thing

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Laz, on a pedal?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> 8 sided die lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Usually the line differentiates the 6 from 9
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh I read dB lmao
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But...there's no 9
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> .g octahedron
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Oh Greek, you so predictable
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Laz maybe the line is so people don't look at it upside down and think it's a 9
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But it's only got 8 sides
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Maybe it's for us drunks that play while drinking?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah but maybe you're playing with two different numbered sets or something
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> A different story
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But it would be the most sensical answer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Sensible
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> My set has like the usuals and a few odd ones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I mean unless they just think 6 is badass
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean, say you were using a 8 sided die and a 9 sided die too for some reason
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> 4, 6, 8, 10, 20 and for some reason I have a 30
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I have literally never used a d30
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah see I bet the 10 would be kind of hard to tell apart from the 8

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> But have never used it myself
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Should use them for craps lol

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Yeah Buddha seems easier than trying to keep this connected but irssi kind of sucks as far as nick alerts goes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> there are other options
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> irccloud
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I basically gotta take the whole damn thing apart anyway
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> I wouldn't even need a vps since my desktop is always on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i bet i could have mary alert my mobile somehow when i get nickalerted
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> There's a doghouse on it?
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha word, looks like it needs a good paint job
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> like an IFTTT
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> bitch about painting a truck is you gotta pull the bed to paint that little gap inbetween the cab and bed
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol the dog house is fenders, core support, hood, etc
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Oh lol
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> first thing I gotta do is get the bitch off the ground
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> I kinda like my OB with no cover, it makes more clearance too
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Just kinda piled up on 10, Vyan's got 7, and Santigold
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> it's lowered nad bagged and the guy kept the compressor
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> that looks heavy af 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> haha eggbot wtf
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Wow wtf
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> It actually looks like Volvo's outback lookalike 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> this looks like an abortion without it
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> where's the pic
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I poped it back on there but it has a crack in it from before anyway plus I cracked it again

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> http://zagnuts.ddns.net/zm/?view=frame&eid=2368&fid=63
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> I've got a different front end I could just put it back to a chevy but if you have the option for a cadillac dually I gotta go caddy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha nice security cam pic
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Only reason I would out a cover in it now is because the atf filter is kind of exposed 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Lol quickest place I knew had a good picture of my fronted 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> yeah that it's not noticeable without the cover
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] -!- mode/#smoke [+h Mary] by ZigZag
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> mine is styrofoam with ugly ass brackets hanging out
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> I had to drill holes into that shirt to get the license plate on
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Shit is hardened steel
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> lol yeah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> try mounting a plow on a k5 blazer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> I wouldn't mind getting a new hood and headlight but I think I am keeping that the way it is
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha'
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> $20 dewalt steel bit lasted 3 holes
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Lol I should mount a plow on this...
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Lol jeez
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> they have those little snow dog ones
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I know very little about working on cars. I had to take the bumper off the Celica to replace one of the headlight bulbs and I had to like look it up online
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> What was is like quarter inch thick stock 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> haha nice
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I also don't know why it's the only car I've had that required me taking off the bumper to access behind the headlight assembly
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Buddha I'm getting a pack or two of heady topper for free tomorrow
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> ive still got the 84 celica
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nice Laz
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Well technically today
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> my uplander you gotta do shit like that
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Dude went to the alchemist brewery and got a case each of the 3 kinds
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Kenny> Lol my outback would need me to take the cover off to do a lot of stuff 
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i gotta disconnect the alternator every time i move it or it'll drain the battery
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> was like "i can only drink it so quick, I'll throw you some for free"
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> o...okay
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I paid $6 for a can of heady topper on Phish lot this summer
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> like shit
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> .np premium2g
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> crazy though because the thing that locks the headlight into place is also the next wrench you need to do the turn signal
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nice

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> when they bulldozed the place I wanted to get a pic of it ontop of the pile of rubble but they cleared it out that same day
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> would have made some nice abstract art
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <GhostofCT> something about the duality of man blah blah blah
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> i havent seen a kmart in ten years
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> saw a big lots though. those places suck

[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it was never top tier writing or anything that would win an Emmy
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> but I feel like the last two seasons or so really got weird and aimless for a good while
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> and I hated the finale so much
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the show left a sour taste in my mouth
[GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i remember the stuff with juice being kind of retarded
