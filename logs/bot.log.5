[2017-01-21][08:55:54] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We sat outside the gates of that and laughed our asses off for like an hour at people dancing to nothing

[2017-01-21][08:57:01] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Then went back to my site and ate my entire camp's supply of veggies
[2017-01-21][08:57:23] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> We had like four bags of carrots, celery, cucumbers once we figured out how a knife works
[2017-01-21][08:57:24] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> hahaha

[2017-01-21][08:58:07] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Shit was wild

[2017-01-21][08:58:30] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Then we tried to play pool
[2017-01-21][08:58:38] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was so amazed at how beautiful the balls and table were
[2017-01-21][08:58:42] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> One game took like 4hrs

[2017-01-21][15:12:02] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I don't know, tbh
[2017-01-21][15:12:21] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I know it can make apps on basically any platform because of jvm, and that it can do all manner of website dev
[2017-01-21][15:12:33] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I mean, can't it?
[2017-01-21][15:12:33] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I have been thinking about smart home shit

[2017-01-21][15:12:59] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm p sure java could talk with arduino
[2017-01-21][15:13:00] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So like, mak a raspberry pi with a motor servo attached, hook it to the wall, and then you can log in and use it to open or close your drapes
[2017-01-21][15:13:02] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> SOmething like that
[2017-01-21][15:13:28] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> maybe not Java SE but I bet EE or some extension could do it
[2017-01-21][15:13:38] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I'm far from an expert

[2017-01-21][15:16:39] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I gotta read peer review for a story I wrote
[2017-01-21][15:16:48] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> That sounds fun
[2017-01-21][15:16:53] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's frustrating when people that can barely read tell you a piece of your writing is hard to understand
[2017-01-21][15:17:13] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> It's like, what do you do with that information...  You can't be rude and be like "Hard for you" lol
[2017-01-21][15:17:15] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But do you dumb it down?
[2017-01-21][15:18:26] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Maybe there are effective ways of saying the same thing with more common vernacular, in places.
[2017-01-21][15:18:40] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah that's what I'm thinking
[2017-01-21][15:18:48] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Seems like a vocabulary barrier in a lot of places
[2017-01-21][15:18:56] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] * SagaciousKJB needs to stop being a walking dictionary
[2017-01-21][15:18:56] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yes
[2017-01-21][15:19:31] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> But I mean, at the same time, some of the people are literally fresh out of high school and when I listen to them read the class material allowed, it's obvious they are not really strong readers.
[2017-01-21][15:19:31] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <CaliGangstar> everyone needs an editor
[2017-01-21][15:19:47] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> So I don't know what to do when a person like that says they don't understand like, is it me, or them
[2017-01-21][15:19:48] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> CaliGangstar, have you played the new Hitman at all

[2017-01-21][15:20:21] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the first mission was fun. I played it a few times to knock out the challenges
[2017-01-21][15:20:28] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> it makes the challenges really easy to find, and encourages a lot of replay
[2017-01-21][15:20:29] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> its great man
[2017-01-21][15:20:35] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I saw my buddy playing that one, he was hiding in dumpster most of the time lol
[2017-01-21][15:20:35] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Blood Money 2 basically
[2017-01-21][15:20:48] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> He had to kill some chick he said looked like Hilary Clinton

[2017-01-21][15:20:57] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> mission
[2017-01-21][15:20:59] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I didn't really see the resemblance.  Dressed more like the queen
[2017-01-21][15:21:51] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I really like those games
[2017-01-21][15:22:04] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Even the awkward shooting combat and sometimes odd AI stuff
[2017-01-21][15:22:43] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> the replay value and the multitudes of ways of completing a mission are unmatched. I got more out of Blood Money than just about any other game of that type

[2017-01-21][15:31:46] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> what would be interesting but way more depressing is how much money i've spent on weed
[2017-01-21][15:32:20] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> lol Right
[2017-01-21][15:32:30] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Dude just think about how much you spent on weed 10 years ago versus now
[2017-01-21][15:33:06] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I use to spend almost $100 on a quarter
[2017-01-21][15:33:11] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> 10 years yeah.. but like 12-13 it was way lower

[2017-01-21][15:34:37] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> it wasn't always literally 5
[2017-01-21][15:35:12] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> some dudes definitely got suckered into paying a lot more
[2017-01-21][15:37:17] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> lol
[2017-01-21][15:37:21] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> some people had 5 on it

[2017-01-21][15:38:34] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> we used to ditch and go to my friend's house near the school to smoke. it was nice and convenient and a lot of people knew it was a chill spot. so there was always the occasional rich kid or something who would show up with like an oz and blow our minds lol
[2017-01-21][15:40:09] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Ghostbot> Buddha CaliGangstar SagaciousKJB 15mins have passed since the last b.

[2017-01-21][15:40:27] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> I just ended up not liking to smoke with lots of people
[2017-01-21][15:40:32] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> They were alwasy dumbasses and that's how they got caught
[2017-01-21][15:40:38] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Get caught up in the mean time
[2017-01-21][15:40:39] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> yeah same. our routine was to smoke and watch half baked

[2017-01-21][15:41:23] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> we watched all kinds of shit. our favorite thing was to flip channels and craft bits about shit on tv
[2017-01-21][15:41:29] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> dave mirra bmx was the shit man
[2017-01-21][15:41:32] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i miss that game

[2017-01-21][15:42:48] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That Will Smith movie that came out about that is pretty good
[2017-01-21][15:42:56] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> The CTE stuff I mean
[2017-01-21][15:43:22] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i haven't seen it yet but i heard that
[2017-01-21][15:43:35] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Alexander> i remember jada making a big deal that he wasn't nominated for an oscar for it

[2017-01-21][20:51:29] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> one of my favorite things is to kill people with random objects
[2017-01-21][20:51:36] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> did they put it out as a physical copy?
[2017-01-21][20:51:39] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> also, to try and get through as much of a level as possible without changing out of my hitman suit
[2017-01-21][20:51:51] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> nah I bought digital cuz that's how I do now
[2017-01-21][20:51:52] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I went full autismo this summer

[2017-01-21][20:52:11] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Blood Money is by far the best hitman game
[2017-01-21][20:52:12] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> tru
[2017-01-21][20:52:35] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> yeah and this is basically Blood Money 2
[2017-01-21][20:52:42] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Yeah I played like two levels
[2017-01-21][20:52:44] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i was starting to go digital but games are sitting at 40gb + updates
[2017-01-21][20:52:45] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It was rad
[2017-01-21][20:53:00] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I gotta say though my favorite stealth game ever
[2017-01-21][20:53:02] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Chaos Theory.
[2017-01-21][20:53:23] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> microsofts servers are way too shitty to handle that
[2017-01-21][20:53:36] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> especially since they dont give a single fuck about australia
[2017-01-21][20:53:40] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <eggbot> Are especially easy
[2017-01-21][20:54:17] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> i think the only stealth game ive ever enjoyed was dishonoured
[2017-01-21][20:54:26] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the new hitman does look fun as fuck though
[2017-01-21][20:54:53] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was not a fan of Dishonored
[2017-01-21][20:55:03] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> It's just a totally different style than Hitman or Splinter Cell
[2017-01-21][20:55:09] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> oh yeah, for sure
[2017-01-21][20:55:17] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> im a fan of the gameplay mechanics
[2017-01-21][20:55:21] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> I was rec'd it because of that which is the only reason I didn't like it
[2017-01-21][20:55:23] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> I beat Dishonored 2 but I wasn't in love with it.
[2017-01-21][20:55:29] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Buddha> Hitman, though. That's my love.
[2017-01-21][20:55:29] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> the story and world were pretty horrible
[2017-01-21][20:55:30] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> "Oh you love Splinter Cell, try Dishonored"
[2017-01-21][20:55:33] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <Laz> Ummm
[2017-01-21][20:55:59] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <prem> yeah, in contrast with what i just said, the most disappointing purchase ive ever made was dishonoured 2

[2017-01-21][22:27:42] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Laz maybe the line is so people don't look at it upside down and think it's a 9

[2017-01-21][22:28:14] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Yeah but maybe you're playing with two different numbered sets or something
[2017-01-21][22:28:18] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> That too

[2017-01-21][22:29:01] [INFO] [GhostNetwork:#smoke] <SagaciousKJB> Well I mean, say you were using a 8 sided die and a 9 sided die too for some reason
